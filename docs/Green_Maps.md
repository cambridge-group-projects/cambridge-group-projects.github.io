In an effort to tackle climate change, we would like to reduce our
carbon footprint. Therefore, we want to offer people insights into the
carbon footprints of various transit options. Your task is to develop a
system which finds routes using various transport types (cycling, car,
train, plane) and computes the costs, travel time and carbon footprints
of them. In the end, the user can then make an informed decision on what
mode of transport to take.
