The trombone is a beautiful instrument, at its best when viewed from
multiple sides and heard from a distance, as in this video by Phil
Cambridge: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAM2qJ0m7Oc>. Like Phil, we
could all do with better tools for composing and publishing multitrack
audio and video streams of the kind that became familiar during
lockdown. Your task is to create a music-specific multitrack video
editor with everything a brass player needs, perhaps incorporating solo
and chorus, virtual camera pan and rotate of instruments and chamber
groups, hip hop loops and video stutters, or other effects suited to
your favourite music genres.
