Computer Science education expert Mark Guzdial suggests kids can learn
effectively from Task-Specific Programming (TSP, or "teaspoon")
languages that can be learned in a few minutes, teaching one idea from
theoretical CS (the medicine?) in the context of a motivational and
interesting automation task (like a teaspoon of sugar to help it go
down). Your job is to create one of these educational languages, that
teaches an important computing concept in a form relevant to processing
social media video.
