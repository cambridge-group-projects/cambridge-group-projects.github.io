Earlier this year, for a period of one week, we deployed around
Cambridge 90 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras. This has
provided anonymized timestamped journey segment data for about 4,000,000
vehicle movements between pairs of cameras. Your task is to provide a
tool that supports flexible end-user analysis and visualisation of this
data. For the same time period we also have car park occupancy
information as well as major road journey time information derived from
the real-time position of buses and it may be of interest to relate the
ANPR data to these sources.
