Client: Paul Reid, BT <paul.reid@bt.com>

Large networks such as the BT phone network generate terabytes of
routing metadata, but the size of the dataset makes it difficult to
interact with that data in realtime. This means that threats to the
network - whether natural disasters or intentional attacks - may not be
recognised until it is too late. Your task is to create a threat
visualisation and rapid response tool that uses the Hadoop distributed
data framework to identify network vulnerabilities from data traffic
analysis, and helps to plan and prioritise technical responses.
