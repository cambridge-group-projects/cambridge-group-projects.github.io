Many data journalists report information collected from people who are
Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic, but this "WEIRD"
demographic does not represent the majority of people in the world.
AfroBarometer collects data from 33 different countries on the African
continent, and makes it openly available. Your task is to create a tool
that maps datasets from AfroBarometer onto key current issues in the UK
news media, helping readers in this country get a better global
perspective.
