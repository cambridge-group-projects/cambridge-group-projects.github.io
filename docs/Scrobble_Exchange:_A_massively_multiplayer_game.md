Scrobble Exchange - A Massively Multiplayer Game

Last.fm is the world's most popular music recommendations website with
tens of millions of users. Users
scrobble<<http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=Scrobbling>> tracks
that they listen to, which we collate into charts which show the most
popular artists and tracks and can be filtered by geography and genre.
Using our extensive API<<http://www.last.fm/api>>, this project's goal
is to create an online multiplayer game where users can invest in a
portfolio of artists and gain returns based on the performance of their
portfolio. The mechanics of the game are up to you but you should take
steps to prevent cheating, and implement market dynamics so users'
behaviour has a visible effect on the market price of an artist. A
successful project would likely see implementation on Last.fm and be
made available to our large userbase, so scability is a key design goal,
as is portability to the Last.fm operating environment (Python or PHP
against a Postgres database under Debian Linux).
