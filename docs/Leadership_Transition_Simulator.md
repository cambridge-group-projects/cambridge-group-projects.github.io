Client: Megan Renoir, Stopping as Success <meganrenoir@gmail.com>

International agencies work hard to support low-income communities in
becoming self-sufficient and taking control of their own progress toward
the sustainable development goals. However Western-style policy reports
and training documents are not always the best way to support local
leadership skills. Your task is to develop an app that can be used in
conversation between local communities and international partners,
building on training documents like “How to Access Unrestricted Funding”
from the Stopping as Success project. The interactive features should
build the users' confidence in determining their own future, for example
through simulations, group role play or scenario development, and be
more digestible for local language translation and adaptation than plain
text documents.
