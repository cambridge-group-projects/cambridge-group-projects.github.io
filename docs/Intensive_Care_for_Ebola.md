One of the major challenges in Ebola outbreak regions is information
management. Most patient care is done by people with neither medical nor
IT experience, and often low levels of literacy. Their training is often
only 3 or 4 days, mostly focusing on hygiene and use of protective
clothing. Your goal is to create an electronic patient record system
that will run on a smartphone, suited to the network connections, power
supply and hardware limitations in rural Africa. The system should help
regular collection and progression monitoring of symptom reports and
vital signs as would be done in a hospital intensive care unit, for
example using TPP's SystmOne. It might also present users with advice on
triage and patient care. Deployment should be easily customisable for
local languages, and provide mechanisms to feed data back to
international coordination bodies such as the World Health Organisation.
