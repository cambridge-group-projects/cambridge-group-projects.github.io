Perhaps better to call this "Audible Appliances"?

Many home appliances would be perfectly usable by visually impaired
users, except for interaction via a display screen. An example is the
exercise bicycle owned by your client. Your task is to create a simple
accessory that can be attached to the bicycle display screen, using a
Raspberry Pi camera to find and decode relevant parts of the display,
and read necessary information out loud during an exercise session. In
principle, this functionality could provide a customisable screen reader
that might be attached to any kind of device to add screen reader
functionality.

Note potential to work with a "good cause" client - cf [Sailing by
