Client: Konrad Maliszewski, Atheon <konrad.maliszewski@atheon.co.uk>

The design strategy of “gamification” uses familiar features of
videogames like high scores, personal bests or daily streaks to improve
incentives and enjoyment of everyday life. In the retail logistics
sector, especially key-worker areas like food retail, there are many
data feeds and performance measures available. Some retail sites do
provide game-like feedback to staff and customers, but there are many
opportunities to make this enjoyable rather than an oppressive
obligation. Your client is a leader in retail data science, and you’ll
have an opportunity to work with real data from real stores to see how
key-worker’s lives might be improved.
