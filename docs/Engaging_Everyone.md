Client: Rachel Gardner, Communications Manager

Many public events and services aim to include young people, with
meaningful attention to their specific views and needs. Our own outreach
activities, such as the huge Cambridge Festival (next taking place on
16th March 2024) want to ensure that feedback from visiting families
includes all visitors, especially where “family” feedback might
otherwise only engage adults through traditional surveys. Your task is
to create a fun and engaging online tool that encourages people of all
ages to share their views, and is inclusive and motivational for the
young. If successful, we can deploy this at the Cambridge Festival as
soon as it is finished.
