As AI-controlled vehicles like Google's Self-Driving Car become more
common, the person who gets to work fastest will be the one with the
best algorithms. Your task is to create a competitive market in which
members of the public can submit algorithms to see which is the best.
You'll need to define a simple scripting language and API suitable for
creating the entries. Users should be able to enter their script
directly into an interactive game then see its performance in an actual
real-time car race created with the Unity graphics engine and physics
model. The best entries should be stored and ranked in a leader board,
with new players able to see existing code and tweak it for better
performance. In future, this kind of algorithm market could be applied
to other problem domains such as finance.
