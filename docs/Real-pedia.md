The training data for AI large language models mixes up Wikipedia
articles with random text from social media trolls and commercial
sponsors. Many voices are excluded, from the girls not being educated in
Afghanistan, to the women who teach their own families all over the
world. Your goal is to make an alternative wiki architecture, where the
benchmark of authority is not who has the most money or followers, but
the best reflection of those voices. Youâ€™ll need to think about what
motivates women to spend their time this way, what kind of devices they
have access to, and what makes knowledge reliable. Your prototype might
be a small start, but the AI of the future depends on a better way of
understanding what is meaningful, and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
should be available to discuss this with you.
