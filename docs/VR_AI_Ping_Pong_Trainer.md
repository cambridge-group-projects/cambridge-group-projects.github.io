AI and VR are the most exciting areas in computer science today, and
this is a chance to bring them together. We would like you to create a
VR application displaying a simple view of a Table Tennis table, bats,
and ball, and an environment to administer a game of Ping-Pong. However,
we would like the opponent to be an AI which you are attempting to
coach. It may be useful to have the option to run fast automatic
training also to refine your bots, but the ultimate aim is to provide
some human training, and to be able to play them directly in VR. It may
also be interesting to pitch two independently trained bots against each
other, and see how they behave. Rather than arcade games using different
function buttons, ping pong can be controlled wholly from position,
rotation and motion of a bat, suggesting that all user interaction might
be implemented using a Wiimote controller.
