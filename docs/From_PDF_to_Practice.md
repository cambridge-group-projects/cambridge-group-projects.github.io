Many hospitals and trusts in the UK produce their own local guidance,
regarding what medicines should be given to patients before and after
operations (perioperative medication). Policy is buried in PDF documents
and academic papers, which combine descriptions of drug properties with
factors that might result in different advice to different patients.
Your task is to create a system that can automatically extract and
compare a wide range of such advice, presenting it in a form such that
clinicians can draw on both best practice and individual factors when
advising a specific patient.
