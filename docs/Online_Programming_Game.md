To teach beginning programmers problem solving and coding skills, we
would like you to build an online programming game platform. The idea is
for players to program bots which play a multi-player move-based game
(e.g. Battleships, Snake, Pacman). The platform should expose a simple
API through which the players can retrieve the current state of the
game, and publish their next move. It should then display these moves
into a visual representation of the game, allowing players to see how
their bots are doing.
