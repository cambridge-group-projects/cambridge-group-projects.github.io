Guitar tabs are a simple and popular alternative to music notation for
guitar students, as well as guitarists and bassists in cover bands. The
tab tells you where each string needs to be held, but not how to get
enough fingers into the right places. That requires a clever algorithm,
perhaps AI-assisted. Your task is to build an app that automatically
converts tabs, from sites like ultimate-guitar.com, into a 3D animated
hand that shows a student how to hold their hand on the fretboard.
