Ecommerce retailers face a seemingly insurmountable barrier to being
able to fully automate their online marketing activity. Many marketing
channels, such as price comparison sites Google Shopping and Kelkoo, or
marketplaces eBay and Amazon, require formatted product data, but each
has its own format. Most retailers struggle to adapt their product data
to these many distinct formats. This problem manifests itself mostly in
the process of product category mapping: that is, the mapping of a
retailer's list of product categories onto a different category
taxonomy. This is an issue that has caused problems for some of the
world's largest ecommerce companies. The aim of this project will be to
develop an ecommerce-optimised tool that uses heuristic or statistical
algorithms to takes an unmapped category (and potentially other product
information) and output a proposed mapping and confidence level. A user
interface will need to be created to allow human users to view a list of
mappings by confidence level, make manual corrections to mappings, add
to the training set, and view the progress of the mapping.
