Information Extraction from Semi-structured Web Pages

Although content on the web is written using a common structured markup
language, the implementation by different websites varies widely: Your
task is to implement an information extraction system that can extract
content from e-commerce websites. Your system should be able to reliably
extract product content and data from a variety of semi-structured
product pages. You should then build a web application around this
algorithm. Examples include: an e-commerce aggregator, effectively
allowing shoppers to browse products from a broad swathe of online
retailers, or a comparison site for clothing that can compare competitor
products across brands by intelligently matching metadata.

Feedback:

Harry - can you give a little more information about what new business
opportunities might be possible as a result of extracting the
information? I'd like to identify some more specific technical
challenges - at the moment, it seems like the intention would be just to
create another price comparison or retail aggregator site. This is a
fairly crowded market, so it's possible that students would not see much
novelty.
