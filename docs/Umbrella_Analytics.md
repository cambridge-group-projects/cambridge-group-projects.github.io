2021 project; [De-biasing the Employment
Process](De-biasing_the_Employment_Process "wikilink")

Introduced via [Ideaspace](Ideaspace "wikilink")

Suggestion: might it be appropriate to build an experimental prototype
of some kind of “bias alert” app, that could integrate analysis of news
coverage about a company with scanning of internal correspondence, and
perhaps also whistleblower channels? To make this less commercially
sensitive, it could focus on policy bias, health response, or political
instability
