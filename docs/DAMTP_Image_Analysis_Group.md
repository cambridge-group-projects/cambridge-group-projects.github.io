Intelligent Tools for Coeliac Disease Diagnosis

In principle, computer vision and machine learning methods can be used
to recognise coeliac disease. Currently, images of biopsies of gut
tissue are examined by pathologists to diagnose the presence or absence
of coeliac disease. This project involves automating part or all of this
process to allow for much faster and more accurate diagnosis, making use
of machine learning methods with other tools (for example image
editors).
