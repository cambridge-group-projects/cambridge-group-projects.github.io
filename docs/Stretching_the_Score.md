Client: Philip Hazel, PMW

Anyone who has learned a musical instrument or taken a music lesson at
school is likely to have seen printed scores created with Sibelius, one
of the most famous software companies to have come from Cambridge. The
Sibelius tools make it very easy to print music in the way it has looked
for 200 years or more, but very hard to adapt with typographic
innovations that make music easier. Your goal is to create an
alternative specification language and rendering chain for music
notation, perhaps using standards like MusicXML and the scripting
language embedded in Sibelius. Your client is also the author of a major
open source music typesetting system, and you'll be welcome to
experiment with or borrow from his code base.
