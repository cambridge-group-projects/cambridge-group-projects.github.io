Many people struggle to learn basic ideas of probability distributions
and sampling, despite the fact that we see these around us all the time.
The Galton Board (see galtonboard.com) is an elegant and intuitive
mechanical simulation that makes the origin of Gaussian distributions
very clear. Unfortunately physical Galton Boards are costly to build.
Your task is to make a customisable animated simulation - but not just
of a single distribution. Users should be able to chain multiple boards
together, associating them with descriptive equations, creating a visual
probabilistic programming language that implements composition of
Gaussian kernels as a zoomable giant pinball machine that can help teach
conditional probability and an intuitive derivation of Bayes theorem.
