[Drone Safety](Drone_Safety "wikilink")

When drones fly beyond direct human control, they must plan routes that
meet operating and safety criteria. For example, a delivery drone needs
to make a number of visits within time constraints, while public safety
and policing may require repeated surveys of a specific area. Different
drones have different capabilities; some can hover, others cannot, while
others require more regular charging. Routing drone traffic safely is
also challenging: avoiding airspace restrictions, manned aviation and
ground hazards, like crowded roads and pedestrian areas. Your goal is to
create a cloud-based air traffic control system that registers flight
plans, modifies them in response to hazards based on safety data
maintained by Altitude Angel, and makes route alterations in real-time
to avoid other drones, as well as gatherings of people identified
automatically from real-time Cambridge ground data including WiFi
network registrations and public transport locations.
