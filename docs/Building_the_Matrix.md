Successful virtual reality systems have to get just the right balance
between system performance and human response. The time coordination
issues in distributed multi-player VR are even more challenging. This
project is a chance to test your skills in all of these. We have two
Oculus Rift headsets, and your goal is to use these to demonstrate a
time-critical distributed VR game. The scenario is cricket - one player
runs up and bowls, the other bats. Both have to get the timing exactly
right (you can use keyboard/mouse input or a USB game controller if you
prefer). The VR rendering can be in a style of your choice - either
realistic players and wicket, sci-fi/alien cricket, or even cyberspace
cricket in the style of William Gibson's original Matrix, where batting
and bowling are just metaphors to control financial, business or
political transactions.
