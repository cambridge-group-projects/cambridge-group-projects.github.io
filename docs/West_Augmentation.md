The view from the William Gates building, until recently a peaceful
meadow for grazing horses, is now a building site. The public exhibition
for this year’s group design projects will look out at it. Your task is
to create an augmented reality experience for visitors to explore an
alternative speculative design. Visitors should be able to toggle
between an AR visualisation of the buildings currently planned for that
site, and a radically different style of building including
parametrically generated plants and environmental features such as “tree
tenants” (after Hundertwasser), urban farming, wildlife sanctuary etc.
Visitors should be able to explore and interact with the augmented scene
via multiple linked devices, including mobiles, large screens,
projectors and VR headsets.
