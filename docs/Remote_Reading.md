In recent times, many small children are more likely to have multiple
smartphones in their house than multiple grandparents. Can multiple
phones, tablets, TVs and laptops be used to provide some physical
experience of cuddling up in an armchair while somebody far away reads a
picture book? Grandparents often have only a single device, so other
aspects must be simulated. Can the readerâ€™s voice be recorded for future
replay (using voice recognition to synchronise to page turns and allow
special requests)? And if the book is digital, can children add their
own pictures (either drawing or photos) and offered in an online library
for all to enjoy?
