There are several ways that computers can "read your mind" by observing
emotional state - measuring skin conductance, or even estimating pulse
rate with a camera pointed at your face. A dedicated device like the
Raspberry Pi could run its own web server, serving a single page that is
modified according to the detected emotional state of the user. Of
course, it should be possible to customise this behaviour with a simple
end-user language, so that different texts or images are included in the
page in response to different detected emotions. Finally, friends should
be able to add their own supportive feedback to the page ... using
appropriate security!
