The residents of the Galapagos Islands could be more involved in
conservation research, leading to educational and business
opportunities, through using their mobile phone to interact with
research data. Your client has field recordings of birdsong collected
from the Islands, and your task is to use this to train machine learning
tools that can identify species and bootstrap locally distinctive
citizen science activities. You will need to provide cloud facilities
for data management and analysis, as well as phone-based client software
that allows the users to contribute to research activities in ways that
bring them positive educational and economic benefits.
