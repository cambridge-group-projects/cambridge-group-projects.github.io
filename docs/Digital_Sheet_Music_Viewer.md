A musical score is in effect a single line of n bars. Lines, pages, and
to some extent repeat markers appear due to the score being printed on a
page. Your task is to design software that allows a user to have
complete freedom to arrange a musical score on their chosen display (be
it a laptop, tablet, mobile-phone, or projector) in a format that best
suits that display and their needs. Starting with a free digital format
of the score, the software should allow users to manipulate on-screen
scaling, rearrange the score layout using drag & drop of bars,
automatically advance in a way that doesn't interrupt play, and supports
annotation by one or more users. Ideally, it should be possible to
capture the score using OCR from a scan of a paper copy. And of course,
when playing in a group, it would be preferable to synchronise all of
these functions across the screens used by multiple players.
