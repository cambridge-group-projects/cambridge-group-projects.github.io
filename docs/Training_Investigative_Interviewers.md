Investigative interviewing is a critical step in gathering evidence for
any investigation. The types of questions posed by the investigators can
make or break the accuracy of a witness' testimony. Therefore,
investigators and legal professionals have to get specialised training
and continuous feedback in order to keep up with best interview practice
to secure best evidence. However, legal professionals and government
organisations are typically working under limited resources. Your task
is to build an easily accessible app for them to practice their
questioning skills and get instant feedback (e.g., using large language
models to detect question types and detect leading/suggestive practice)
to help them continuously improve their practice beyond their training
sessions. The data set you will be working with are (fully anonymised,
of course) real-life child abuse cases investigative interview and court
transcripts, which are extremely sensitive materials. So your
contribution will really be making a difference for better justice!
