Arable crops in the countryside around Cambridge rely on soil nitrogen,
but many farming practices are wasteful of this critical resource,
potentially leading to other environmental risks. Your goal is to use
recent advances in satellite imagery and robot/drone application to
implement optimisation algorithms for the Ramp Calibration Strip method.
Real data can be used in to construct realistic field simulations, but
there may also be an opportunity to engage with trial tests in an
experimental field north of Cambridge.
