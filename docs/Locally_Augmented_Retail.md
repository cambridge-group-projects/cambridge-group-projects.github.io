Client: Paul Bowes, Bacchanalia <Team@winegod.co.uk>

New retail support apps often focus on providing uniform services to
individual consumers, regardless of where they are in the world. A key
part of many such business models is that the service operator owns the
relationship with the buyer, sometimes leaving local retailers as little
more than a supply chain fulfilment node. However, in taste-based
sectors such as the wine trade, a relationship with an expert who knows
your tastes is far more valuable than a recommender algorithm. The goal
of this project is to provide similar augmented reality functionality to
the Vivino app (which records information on your wine tastes by
recognising photographs of wine labels), but in a way that develops a
personal relationship with a local retailer rather than just a personal
diary. Cambridge wine merchant Paul Bowes will act as client to provide
an expert industry perspective.
