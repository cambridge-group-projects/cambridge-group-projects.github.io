Arm is creating optimised computer vision and machine learning libraries
for processors like the one in your phone. Anyone can train a neural
network using these libraries to recognize images of vegetables,
animals, objects, etc so long as they have enough examples of labelled
classification decisions. In a vegetable market, the stallholder has
"labelled" all the vegetables by putting them in different bins. So AI
Chef aims to train a network that will use those thousands of those
labels (from phone video) to solve the eternal dilemma "what do we eat
this evening?": standing in front of a stall at the Cambridge Sunday
market, AI Chef automatically recognizes which vegetables are on sale,
identifies a recipe based on them and provides you with a shopping list
of the other things you need to buy before you go home to cook.
