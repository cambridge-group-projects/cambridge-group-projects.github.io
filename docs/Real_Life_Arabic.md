Client: Saussan Khalil, Kalamna <smk58@cam.ac.uk>

Mother tongue literacy is a major problem for young people across North
Africa and the Middle East. The classical Arabic they are taught is like
an Italian learning Latin. Apps like Duolingo do not help learners
connect with the everyday language. They need a language learning app
that enriches their lives with “kalamna” - the Arabic for “our words”.
Your task is to design an app with motivating game functionality that
connects to the Arabic needed in real life.
