The Cambridge University Map supports a sophisticated annotation API,
based on GeoJSON. The resulting map functionality can be neatly embedded
in a page using an iframe.

Create a mashup that uses the Talks.cam API with some natural language
processing to create an itinerary for a visitor with cross-disciplinary
interests, for example to all the research groups that host seminars on
neuroscience, or infectious diseases. If the academic visitor is feeling
a little lazy, the talks might be a little less clearly related, but
within a shorter walking distance. The final result should include a
programme of events, with an embedded interactive map showing how to get
to them.
