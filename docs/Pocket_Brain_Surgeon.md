Brain surgery is difficult, but some procedures are quite routine. The
surgeon could have an Android app with some understanding of the
different options at each step of the procedure, that would advise on
the best option at each step, based on statistical likelihood of
success. The necessary raw data for these decisions is probably
available in national data archives such as the UK Shunt Registry in
Cambridge. However, this data is highly sensitive and confidential. You
need to design a system that allows brain surgeons to authenticate
themselves online before they go into the operating theatre, then
download an encrypted data set that can be used to deliver customised
guidance from their phone during surgery. Needless to say, the user
interface is rather critical - the progress of the surgery must be
communicated to the system without interrupting anything important, and
any questions about what to do next involve minimum button presses
before an answer is delivered (perhaps by speech output, from underneath
the surgeon's sterile gown).
