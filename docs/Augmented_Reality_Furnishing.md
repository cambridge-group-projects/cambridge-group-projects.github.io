Client: Jack Haughton [Argon Design](Argon_Design "wikilink")

It's often difficult to follow furniture assembly instructions, but
augmented reality could make it easy. The Holokit is an exciting low
cost phone accessory with development tools providing the capabilities
of Microsoft's Hololens, but so cheaply that a furniture company could
include one in every pack. The goal here is to provide an AR overlay
that shows customers how to orient parts relative to each other, apply
tools, and any other advice right where it is needed. Your client will
provide a furniture kit, and a phone if you need it.
