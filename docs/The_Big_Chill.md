The Terra API integrates data from all kinds of wearable devices, in a
way that is very attractive for sports enthusiasts and health insurance
companies. Is there any future for people who just want a quiet life,
perhaps chilling with their cat, drinking beer or knitting socks? Why
not use your Apple Watch or Fitbit to make your life more enjoyable
rather than setting more and more performance targets? Your goal is to
make an application so attractive that everyone will understand why your
lifestyle is the coolest. The more devices you integrate via the API,
the less you would need to worry about optimising your life.
