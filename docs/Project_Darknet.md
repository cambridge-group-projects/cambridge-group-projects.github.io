"Darknet" is a new experimental theatre production under development by
a Cambridge graduate for performance next year. It explores computer
hacking, cyber espionage and cyber warfare and aims to give the audience
an experience of the dark side of internet use. We're not sure if this
is legal\*, but we've been thinking that we might use data from the
theatre ticket booking system to mess with their minds at some point
during the show and make them feel like they have been hacked. Your job
is to build a system that helps us do this by any means you can think
of. You can assume that there will be a data projector built into the
set or lighting design, that there's a sound system, that we can change
the script, and we can ask the audience to leave their phones on ... we
have their numbers (and also their seats)!. It's up to you to create
effects that will take the story somewhere a little creepy.
