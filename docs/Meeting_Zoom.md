Meetings by Skype often connect rooms full of people, each appearing as
a tiny dot within the video from a wide-angle camera. It should be
possible to use cross-correlation of signals from separated left and
right microphones to identify who is currently speaking and
automatically zoom the image to a specific region, enlarging the person
who is currently talking to fill the screen. You should implement your
solution as a replacement (software-defined virtual) camera that outputs
a modified video stream, to a standard conferencing application such as
Ring for Linux.
