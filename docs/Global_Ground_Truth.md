Client: Alec Christie (ICCCAD liaison) <apc58@cam.ac.uk>

Local people in rural areas have valuable knowledge about climate change
effects and adaptation, but it is not straightforward to integrate their
observations into scientific evidence and policy frameworks. Your task
is to create a trusted infrastructure that integrates reports from local
people (including photos and voice recordings to be translated as
necessary) into a secure evidence blockchain. The client tools must run
on low-end android phones, and be accessible to people with low
literacy. Processes for authentication and standardisation should
respect traditional authority, cultures and rights of indigenous people,
and expert advice will be available from the International Centre for
Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Dhaka.
