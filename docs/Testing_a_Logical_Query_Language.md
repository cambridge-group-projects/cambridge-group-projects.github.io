Graql is a declarative query language inspired by logic programming
languages for performing real-time deductive reasoning on knowledge
graphs in Grakn. Theoretical properties of query languages can be
verified formally, but it is also important to be able to test language
implementations for conformance. Your task is to build an automated
system for testing Graql's implementation and interrogating the results,
either against a formal semantics for the language or via a more
pragmatic approach. If successful, your code will be contributed back to
Grakn's open-source repositories.
