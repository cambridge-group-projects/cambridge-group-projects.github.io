Rain radar apps are familiar and popular - allowing people to plan their
activities by approaching rain. This project will create the first “air
radar” that uses monitoring of multiple air quality parameters to
predict air movement and local variations in pollution. We can provide
access to recordings of air quality data streams from multiple locations
around Cambridge, and also the Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite
under Azure. You should use machine learning techniques to predict what
happens next. This will involve collecting and integrating other data
such as time of day, traffic movements, temperature, wind speed and
other factors. Your current situation maps and future trend predictions
should be useful not only to cyclists and residents, but to business
analysts and city planners concerned with future environmental health.
