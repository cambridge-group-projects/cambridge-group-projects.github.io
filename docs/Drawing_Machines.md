The ancestors of computer graphics, in the 18th and 19th centuries, used
sophisticated mechanisms to render realistic perspective views,
transform complex geometry, visualize mathematical and real-world data,
and act as human prosthetics. Pablo Garcia’s drawingmachines.org
documents many of these remarkable devices, but we have lost much of the
information on how they really work. The goal of this project is to
build an interactive assembly kit that simulates mechanical drawing
machines, bringing them back to life, and even providing a creative
resource for today’s art students.
