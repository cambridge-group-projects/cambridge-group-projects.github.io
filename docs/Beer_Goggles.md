Augmented reality project for Google Glass that displays the distance to
the nearest pub and shows the direction to go to get there. Obviously,
this could be made more general to provide directions to other types of
destination, either at a street level, or for example giving directions
to a user in an unfamiliar building, but the name wouldn’t work then!

We’d provide one pair of Google Glass glasses (to be returned!).

Feedback: We'd like to include some Google Glass apps this year, and I'm
sure students would be interested. However, we have done quite a few
navigation apps in the past, so I'd like to extend this one (also
slightly concerned that we had to cancel a project called "wine goggles"
last year after lack of interest from students, who perhaps are not so
interested in alcohol as we might assume).
