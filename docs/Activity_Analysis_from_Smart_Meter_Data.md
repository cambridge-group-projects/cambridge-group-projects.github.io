A rapidly aging population means assisted living is fast becoming a
major societal challenge. To support “Carers” assisting “Carees”, local
technology company Informetis provides smart sensors installed in the
fuse-box that determine if household appliances are ON/OFF. As routines
are typically closely related to appliance use, this proxies for
inhabitants' wellness. Your task is to create an app for carers to
support householders when they struggle to perform daily routines. You
may choose focus on detection of activities from the raw data, or the
interaction design challenges of choosing what should be communicated to
the carer and when.
