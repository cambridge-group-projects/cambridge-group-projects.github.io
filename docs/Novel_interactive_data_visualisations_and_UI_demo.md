[BT](BT "wikilink") - suggestion from Ben Azvine

This brief appears more suitable for Part II or MPhil project - has been
shifted there.

BTâ€™s networks are a source of huge quantities of time-varying data which
have many variables. A wealth of information can be extracted from such
data, but initial exploration of the dataset may be formidable,
particularly when the features of the dataset are initially completely
unknown. There are a few standard means of data visualisation including
trend graphs, bubble diagrams, network diagrams, pie charts,
geographical maps, sun ray diagrams, and radial views. This project asks
you to discover alternative Opensource visualisation techniques beyond
these methods and to build an interface using one of these for the
purpose of exploring a large, complex graph dataset visually in a way
that allows discovery of correlations and clusters in the dataset (such
as relatedness in a single or multiple category).
