Project could look at development of a mobile platform for
community-based risk management of loans to people who do not have
access to low-cost financial services.

Some similarity to the [Distributed
Microcontracts](Distributed_Microcontracts "wikilink") project from last
year

Issues to consider: lenders need something that replaces face-to-face
risk assessment; costs must be low to serve low-income market; a mutual
society might be able to establish new social trust mechanisms employing
mobile phone features.

Initial idea:

Community risk sharing

Building a relationship with the customer is an essential part of loan
financing, often face to face in situations where risk is higher. Fair
Finance offers community-based loans to people on low incomes, and need
to expand their operations beyond London. Your task is to build a mobile
app that supports quantified management of financial risk by sharing
data (including location, photos, call records etc) among local members
of a supportive community. Privacy and security will be paramount, as
will sensitivity to the dignity and rights of those living on low
incomes.
