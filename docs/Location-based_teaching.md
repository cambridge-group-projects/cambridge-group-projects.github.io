iBeacons/Bluetooth4 beacons are now being deployed in public, retail,
and office spaces and offer the opportunity for micro-location
applications (i.e. you are near X so execute Y). The CL has a large
deployment of beacons that can provide phones location throughout. Your
task is to create a platform that receives beacon sighting information
from Android/iPhone devices and exposes it as location information that
other can build location-aware applications on. You will then use this
platform to create an educational system. It should be possible for
anyone to use this platform to create new types of face-to-face
interactive content that are advertised as available at particular times
and location. Existing content could be imported automatically from
sites such as talks.cam.ac.uk, lecture and seminar timetables,
supervision management systems and so on, but users should be able to
create new location-based content relevant to other learning or event
types.
