Future First is a charity closing the career gap for those born in
low-income homes, by helping state secondary schools and colleges
develop a thriving and engaged alumni community. Their latest idea is to
develop tools that can be used by schools to create and maintain a
library of videos in which school alumni describe their school
experience and subsequent career. The recording app should structure the
video recording with interview questions, and constrain recording times
relevant to each question with appropriate messages and visual timer
countdown, in a way that is encouraging and user friendly. The system
should allow current students to find alumni with similar interests and
experience to their own. It should also allow school administrators to
manage the library of interviews, customize the interview questions for
their school, and have a workflow for checking and approving new videos
for release.
