Based on conversation with a potential client who has asked for their
details to be removed from the wiki.

Everybody has a different approach to categorising email, but nobody has
time to do it properly. Your task is to create a new kind of email
client that uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to infer topic
clusters from content. The user interface should allow users to deal
with various personalised clusters in different ways according to their
mood and level of concentration at the time. Use the IMAP protocol to
automatically file clustered messages on the server, or (if feeling
brave) automatically reply to them. A useful side effect of this mail
client will be that spam and phishing mail gets the priority it
deserves.
