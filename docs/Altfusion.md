- [History Scraper](History_Scraper "wikilink")

As discussed we’re a local Cambridge software development business and
we like to engage with the local community & university where possible
so I’d certainly be interested in attending these presentations. We
spoke about helping students with internships and if there’s other ways
in which we can help or collaborate then I’m always open to suggestions.
