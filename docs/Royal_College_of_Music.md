Exhibition Inference

The Royal College of Music Museum has one of the richest collections of
music-related objects in the UK and Europe, spanning over 500 years of
musical activity. A new layout has just been created, and the museum
needs to learn how visitors respond to it in order to refine the design
in future. We suggest tracking (with permission) visitors who may use QR
codes to access media or links from a specific exhibition case. Your
task is to combine time-stamp records of QR access with dead reckoning
from a phone's step counter, glimpses of GPS signal through the museum
windows, prior knowledge of valid walking paths around the museum
layout, and any other sources of data you can find, to get the best
estimate of how visitors travel around the museum, as well as which
exhibits they pause at and in which order.
