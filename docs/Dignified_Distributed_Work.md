Client: Lorraine Charles, Na'amal <lorraine@naamal.org>

Na’amal provides refugees and other underrepresented communities
training in marketable skills, with a focus on the human/soft skills
that are required in the global labour market and links them to
dignified digital remote work. The final piece of Na’amal’s work is the
link to employment. However, different partners all have different
requirements for digital employment profiles, involving scarce skills
and labour. Your task is to provide an automated integration platform
that streamlines the connection of Na’amal alumni to opportunities,
amplifying their chances of securing meaningful and sustainable jobs.
