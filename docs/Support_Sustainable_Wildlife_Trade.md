UNEP-WCMC supports many developing countries in assessing the potential
levels for sustainable trade in wildlife for particular species. You
challenge is to use the data provided by existing APIs to power a tool
for countries to follow a methodology for producing these reports for a
given species/family. The tool must be easy to use in target developing
countries and allow the user to provide additional local knowledge to
supplement the global data provided by existing data APIs and finally
produce a summary report for future policy use.
