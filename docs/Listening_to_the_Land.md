Land management on a large scale requires a balance between productivity
and ecological diversity, but it can be very difficult to integrate
different data sources for strategic planning. This project will
integrate remote satellite sensing from the Google Earth Engine with
local bioacoustic surveys from the BTO acoustic pipeline, to visualise
both historical and projected future measures, supporting land managers
to make decisions about crops. harvests, irrigation, tourism and so on.
