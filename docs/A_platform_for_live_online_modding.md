In sandbox games like Minecraft, the only way to define more interesting
game scenarios is to write and install Java mods. It is possible to make
automatic behaviours in the Minecraft world, but only using the
cumbersome "redstone" logic blocks. The goal of this project is to make
a new multi-player sandbox game, based on a 2D grid, where users can
define more complex behaviours by clicking on a grid element to embed
pieces of code written in a scripting language like Lua. You are welcome
to use a commercial or open source rendering engine, but maintaining a
shared persistent world will still involve solving problems of
persistence, networking, live world management and session control.
