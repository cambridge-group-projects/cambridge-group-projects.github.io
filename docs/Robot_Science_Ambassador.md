Client: Oscar Klock, Furhat Robotics

Imagine a robot science ambassador at the Cambridge Festival that
engages visitors in lively discussions about science and their
experiences. This project will develop an embodied agent based on the
world's most advanced social robot from Furhat Robotics, and using the
LEXI framework for speech-based interaction. The system should allow
customisation, so that users of all technical abilities can create and
deploy their own AI agents able to interact naturally in spoken
conversation in a variety of social settings. In the setting of the
Cambridge Festival, the humanoid robot would be able to gather feedback,
as well as enhancing visitor engagement.
