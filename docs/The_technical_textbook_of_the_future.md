In fast-moving technical fields, it is hard to keep good textbooks up to
date. Online resources such as wikipedia are useful ways to collect
expertise, but articles written by technical experts are not always the
best way to learn. It's hard work to collect good teaching examples,
suggest tests and exercises and so on. Your task is to design an
application that offers the best of both worlds - a book that can be
accessed from browsers or mobile devices, preserving a clear voice for
the author, but also allowing mashups at varying levels of granularity
with other textbooks, student forums, class exercises and presentation
materials, and discussion among expert teachers at any level of content.
Different users (schools, teachers, or learners with special needs)
should be able to create the learning paths that suit them best, and
also share them with others. The final product shouldn't look like
another blog, forum or wiki - you will need to think what design
elements and user experiences are associated with a professional and
authoritative knowledge source.
