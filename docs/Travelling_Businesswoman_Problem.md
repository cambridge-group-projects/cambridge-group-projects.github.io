We all need to reduce our Carbon Footprints and for many businesses,
flights are a major component of this. Your task is to prototype an
online system to help a small company (~100 staff) reduce its footprint
by optimising planned travel on an annual basis. Staff should be able to
input potential business trips to other institutions, conferences and
meetings as well as contacts or locations that it would be beneficial to
visit if the opportunity arose. You should consider simple ways to
collect this information and to display advice or suggestions during the
planning of a trip.
