Many companies cause harm and damage to customers in small ways, but
it's not worth employing a lawyer unless a large number of customers
aggregate their compensation claims. The ability to pursue this kind of
class action was introduced to British law in 2015. There is a business
opportunity in identifying which companies can be most profitably sued.
Thousands of people will thank you for it, and the long term effect
would be to improve products and services for everyone. You will need to
use social media - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and anything else that
comes to hand - to work out which companies are most likely to lose a
class action suit in relation to their products or services. Your client
can provide expertise in data mining of legal cases, in order to
optimise training of your statistical models.
