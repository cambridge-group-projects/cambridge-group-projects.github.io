While many activities in Cambridge have transferred reasonably smoothly
to the online world, music has not at all. It’s not even possible to
sing Happy Birthday properly via videoconference, let alone coordinate
choirs or band rehearsals. The Web RTC standard does provide support for
time synchronisation of asynchronous messages, so together with
interfaces such as Web MIDI, it should be possible to get better-timed
music performance. Of course latency doesn’t go away (we still have the
speed of light to deal with) so music made online can naver be like
playing in the same room. Instead, we need music that can be played in
cycles, so that each player contributes content that sounds good to
their own ears now, and still sounds good after a fixed loop interval
(perhaps 4 bars, perhaps 12, or even the next song verse), when the same
notes are distributed and mixed in to the jam that everybody hears
slightly later.
