Financial markets today are one of the biggest raw data generators of
our time, with billions of data points per day for some products. Most
traders need to digest a very large number numerical and graphical
inputs - they use four, six, eight or more screens - but can't see or
reach all the data they need. In this project, you will use an Oculus
Rift VR headset to distribute market data and visualisations in the
virtual space around a trader. By turning their head, or looking up and
down, they should be able to review rapidly changing data in various
formats, and have their attention drawn to the most urgent changes if
they need to act. The design of the visualisations could emulate those
found in products such as Thomson Reuters Eikon - but it will be
necessary to adjust these to the display characteristics of the Oculus
Rift.
