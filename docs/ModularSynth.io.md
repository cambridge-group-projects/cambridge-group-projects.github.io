Sophisticated digital music composition tools like the Sonic Pi language
rely on an internal architecture of samples, waveforms and filters. In
the popular SuperCollider system, a new synthesiser is defined by
software-wiring together these "UGens‚Äù. Your task is to create a
SuperCollider client that looks like a retro-style modular synthesiser
or guitar pedal board, where connecting literal wires between pictures
of hardware modules on the screen will construct an exact digital
equivalent within the SuperCollider server. A live audio input would
give you a universal guitar pedal, sample mixing makes you a
DJ/producer, or if bleeps and whooshes are your thing, you can impress
your Grandpa by channelling Brian Eno in the glory days of Roxy Music.
