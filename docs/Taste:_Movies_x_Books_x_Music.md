There are many music, movie and book recommendation systems online, but
each focuses on a single medium. The goal of this project is to build a
web application which, when given a movie or a book, would present a
cluster of books, movies and songs that are related to it by often being
mentioned online together. It would be cool to see how clusters of
“tastes” form and how books, movies and music from the same artistic
movements naturally pop up together. A timeline could also give an idea
of the art history context, for example the movie Easy Rider might
relate to movies, books and songs popular with the hippy movement.
