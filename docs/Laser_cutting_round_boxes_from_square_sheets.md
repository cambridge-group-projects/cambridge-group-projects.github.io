Kerf bending is a cute method for making round boxes with a laser
cutter, but it requires quite a bit of planning. The goal of this
project is to build a system that can be used by customers to design
their own wooden boxes in arbitrary shapes (e.g. letters of the
alphabet), with the templates for the round sides automatically produced
using kerf bending. The resulting pieces should be suitable for posting
in a flat-pack format, in as few pieces as possible, with tongue and
slot assembly. Examples of the resulting designs will be fabricated
using the Computer Laboratory laser cutter.

need to be arranged with Brian Jones <bdj23@cam.ac.uk>
