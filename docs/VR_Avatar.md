With the growth of online VR spaces, users lack a consistent identity,
and a way of expressing themselves to each other. Create 1) a VR Avatar
API that provides an customisable animating model representing the user,
and 2) an example app to demonstrate its application. The model must
smoothly animate to reflect the user's physical pose from the hand
controller and headset position and orientation data (perhaps employing
inverse kinematics). Provide some means by which a user could drive
emotive animations and expressions (such as shows of surprise, pity or
anger). Consider customisations for the Avatars, and provide some back
end service or 'Shop' for extensions or customisations to be downloaded.
