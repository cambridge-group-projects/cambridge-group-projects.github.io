Strawberry pickers currently spend a significant amount of time (approx.
20%) manually transporting trays to stations, generally at the end of
the field. Autonomous logistics robots provide the opportunity to
increase productivity by transporting the trays, thus reducing the
demand on labour. Your challenge is to create a simulation of a typical
harvesting scenario in ROS Gazebo and develop an optimised algorithm for
efficient multiple robots path planning. Use this to recommend the
minimum number of robots required (e.g. scheduling / logic) â€“ too many
robots will be complex and potentially too expensive, too few will
create delays for the pickers and reduce efficiency. Based on the
simulation results, you should identify required sensor and actuator
technologies in order for the robot to optimally interact with human
staff.
