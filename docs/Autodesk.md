2019 discussion - One of the things Autodesk are looking to do in the
next few years in move manufacturing to the cloud. We are in the early
stages at the moment but should have technology more mature in the next
12 months. At that point I think there could be a number of
opportunities for projects that your students would be interested in
where they could happily take the IP. From stringing together
microservices to automate manufacturing processes to using machining
data to optimise processes…

Sadly at present I only have time to mentor on projects where we would
want to retain IP.

### response

I know that some other universities (mainly outside the UK) charge a fee
for participation in this kind of programme, or even offer contracted
student time as work for hire. In those arrangements, there would
obviously be contractual terms for transfer of IP. I’m always interested
in considering ways to extend our programme.
