Not all trading happens on the exchange -- sometimes counterparties
trade directly through human-to-human communication. In such cases,
humans typically use their most natural interface: voice. Your task is
to create a service which holds market data and responds to queries on
demand in a human-like manner, by automating one side of the process
using modern technologies (voice recognition, natural language
processing and voice production).
