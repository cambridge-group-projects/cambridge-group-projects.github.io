There are many online shopping sites where users become frustrated -
they can't find what they want, get bored, or simply fail to complete a
purchase. Retailers would be happy to help out such customers, if only
they knew which ones were most likely to benefit. If you could predict
which shoppers are about to abandon their shopping basket based on click
stream analysis, then it would be possible to offer the customer
incentives to stay on the site. Incentives could be discounts, pop-ups
or contextual product recommendations.

If successful, the system may be trialled on a large popular e-commerce
site such as MyProtein.com, LookFantastic.com or IWantOneOfThose.com.
