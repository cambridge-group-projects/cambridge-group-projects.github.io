Educational programming languages like Scratch are rather disappointing
for blind children - the visual syntax feedback is no help, the animated
visual output is not motivating, and audio screen readers can't read the
source code back to you. But it should be possible to make an
educational programming language that is easy and motivational for blind
children. It would output music, rather than animations, so blind
children can create their own artistic results. It would create standard
text source code, so screen readers work. Both of these things are
already provided by Sam Aaron's amazing Sonic Pi system, but Sonic Pi
doesn't have a very convenient way for blind children to create musical
code. Your task is to design a simple customisable musical instrument,
using Modular Robotics Cubelets, that outputs its state as a running
Sonic Pi program for children to inspect (using a screen reader) and
modify. You will be able to use a newly-released API for Sonic Pi that
supports code insertion via standard Open Sound Control messages.
