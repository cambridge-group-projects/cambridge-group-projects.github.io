Package delivery by drone might become a reality. Until it does, postal
and delivery services are considering the immediate potential in
remotely driven vehicles. Your task: figure out how to monitor those
vehicles from the sky! The goal is to build a service that tracks a
vehicle with a drone (using a visual, wifi or bluetooth beacon) and
broadcasts the droneâ€™s video output to a web-based interface.
