Cambridge has been named the most unequal city in the UK, with
homelessness, poverty, and unaffordable housing exacerbated by unequal
access to land. The goal of this project is to produce an interactive
visualisation that combines data from the Cambridge Land Justice
campaign with census data, pollution data, the Green Space Index, and
crowd-sourced reports on public access. This project provides an
opportunity to interact with local groups advancing spatial and social
justice in the city, while applying data science to real problems.
