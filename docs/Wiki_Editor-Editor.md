Wikipedia editors are among the few remaining public servants who we can
rely on to distinguish between truth and lies. Many of the first
generation of editors are still around, but the future of human
knowledge might depend on newcomers acquiring better understanding of
how to do this effectively. Your task is to analyse what makes a
Wikipedia editor effective, using the WikiData corpus to identify which
patterns of editing deal with controversies, result in lasting
consensus, and so on. Using the results of this analysis, create an
automated interactive training guide for new editors, giving them
feedback on their own patterns of response, and helping them identify
how they might deal with different cases.
