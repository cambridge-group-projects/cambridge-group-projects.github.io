Client: Jasmin JahiÄ‡, Queens Sustainability Lab <jj542@cam.ac.uk>

Commercial salad growers must operate at scale, stripping whole plants
to truck around the country. In contrast, a typical salad plate or
sandwich may only require a few leaves, beans or fruit from a plant that
can keep growing. Your client has the components for a vertical garden,
but wants to manage this in the most versatile and efficient way
possible, using soil and water sensors together machine vision to
identify every optimal picking point, control water supply, and optimise
use of the energy (intensity of light) for growing the plants.
