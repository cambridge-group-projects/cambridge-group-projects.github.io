There are historic objects around the Gates building that have stories
to tell - if only they could speak! Imagine walking up to one of the
display cases (like the one to the right of the front door), and using
your phone to start a chatbot session as if you were speaking to the
object itself. We will provide Bluetooth location beacons so that an
Android phone can detect which object it is near. Your application
should respond to questions, and maintain a conversation, with style and
content that is customised to each object. The project team will have a
chance to visit some of the famous museums elsewhere in Cambridge, to
learn how curators design interactive content.
