Lecture Theatre 1 in the Gates Building is packed with environmental
sensors that collect all sorts of historical information about air
quality. Imagine if the Metaverse gave you superpowers to go back in
time, and drill in to sensors to find out what data they had collected.
Your task is to create this demonstrator, where VR interaction allows
you to dive in to any sensor and find out what it knows, not simply
flying around in 3D, but entering the unexplored fourth Metaverse
dimension: time itself!
