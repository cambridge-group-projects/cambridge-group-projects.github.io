More than 15 million GP appointments are missed annually, costing the
NHS hundreds of millions of pounds. Your task is to build a proactive,
ethical appointments assistant for a GP surgery that will call or email
patients prior to their appointments to confirm date and time, and
increase the likelihood the patient will attend. There should be a good
conversational flow, with the assistant leading the conversation, and
learning over time how to handle conversations more effectively and even
become personalised based on patients’ input. Extra features include
handling prescription renewal, and appointment booking by phone or
email.
