Financial Battlefield

Attempts to make financial graphs or political trends more entertaining
are often disappointingly unimaginative. We have seen too many VR
mountain ranges and city skylines. Your task is to communicate the
excitement of financial trading data by using the latest gaming
technology. We'll provide powerful GPUs for you to use with the Unreal
game engine and a budget for off the shelf game art and graphics assets.
You will render large scale investment data based on thousands of data
streams as competing armies of simulated characters whose bodies,
weapons and AI behaviour are determined by key market attributes.
