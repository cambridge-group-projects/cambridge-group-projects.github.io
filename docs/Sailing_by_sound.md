People with visual impairments enjoy outdoor activities as much as we
all do, and local sailing organisations are pleased to provide
opportunities for disabled and visually impaired people to experience
sailing. One disappointing limitation is that the standard navigation
instruments (location, windspeed, compass heading etc) all have visual
readouts, so visually impaired people are not able to participate in
this central aspect of sailing. Your task in this project is to create
an embedded device (you will have technical assistance with hardware -
bdj23@cam.ac.uk) that uses a Raspberry Pi to communicate with
navigational instruments using the NMEA2K standard, and provides users
with speech output in response to commands given via a small number of
waterproof buttons on the outside of the unit.
