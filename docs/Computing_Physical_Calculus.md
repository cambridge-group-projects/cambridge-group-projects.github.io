In the days when Cambridge innovators like Turing were still inventing
the foundations of Computer Science, our department was known as the
Mathematical Laboratory, offering a wide range of computation facilities
implemented using mechanical devices. One impressive machine, the
Differential Analyzer was able to solve calculus problems. The goal of
this project is to create a digital working replica of the Differential
Analyzer, which can be used both to illustrate the elegant operation of
this device, and help students to gain an intuitive understanding of
mathematical principles through the visualised behaviour.
