Cambridge buses are fitted with GPS tracking equipment. This is used to
predict the arrival time for the next bus, as displayed on many
bus-stops around the city. It is also collected in an archive of all bus
journeys. It would be nice if the display provided more information, and
did so in a more entertaining way, customised depending on how long the
bus will take to arrive. Information snippets might include confidence
intervals (in layman's terms) for actual arrival time based on historic
data, and comparisons to other journey options. Entertainment might be
automatically generated poems, fictional dialogues etc, that adapt
intelligently to local context such as weather information. news stories
and so on - but at a length appropriate to the remaining time. With
luck, we hope to deploy the resulting system - at least on the stop
outside the Gates building!
