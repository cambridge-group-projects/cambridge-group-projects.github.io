As reported in the media, lack of proper nutrition is a particular
problem for schoolchildren, as it affects their learning and educational
progress. Your task is to produce a system that enables schools to spend
financial gifts from donors at an online supermarket on food, crockery,
etc. to supply clubs that give children a good meal and teach
commercially valuable skills such as programming. The system should
gamify both nutritional and educational needs to encourage the children
to engage, and might consider multiple factors such as cost of items,
and timeliness of delivery. If successful, your project will be released
as open-source for Ocado to deploy.
