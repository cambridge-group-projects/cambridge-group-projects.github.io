1.  FollowMyFundâ€“ Twitter-Based Visualisations and Alerts for Investors

Twitter has famously been first to break many major news stories, so why
is its data not often considered valuable by people in finance? Perhaps
the data is not deemed reliable or presented in a familiar way? Surely,
coupling improved analysis and filtering of Tweets with market data
could provide a novel and useful tool for financial decision-makers. You
will create a dashboard for Investors to monitor their portfolios,
overlaying sentiment gathered from Twitter data. Is a particular company
in a fund trending positively or perhaps not being tweeted about at all?
To make the tool more sophisticated you will also create a system for
configuring alerts about these companies based on the information you
derive from Tweets as well as Market Data such as stock prices or
volumes traded, helping spot the next market mover.

## Alternative proposal

Were you around when a group built the TweetGuv system? Perhaps we could
do something similar with financial commentators who have Twitter feeds,
looking for evidence that they are using the same (or different)
sources?
