Client: Alex Venetidis, Terra <alex@tryterra.co>

Terra API unlocks health and fitness data from diverse sources,
including popular wearables and fitness apps like Fitbit, Apple Watch,
Oura, and 70+ others. Your challenge is to leverage the Terra API to
develop an AI coach that advises people on how to improve their sleep
habits. The coach can be trained using data already acquired by Terra.
Throughout the process you will be prompted to deploy and evaluate the
performance with real users, do user interviews, and iterate on your
product with the goal of attaining 100 users - this stage will also
involve ethical review for deployment of instrumented software.
