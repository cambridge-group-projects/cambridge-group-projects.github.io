Although electricity generation in the UK relies increasingly on
renewables, these only provide low baseline capacity. To meet demand
spikes, electricity companies must burn gas and oil. In principle, smart
meters would allow a social consensus to save the planet – we just can’t
afford 10 million people getting out of bed to switch on their kettles
at the same time! Your client has smart technology already detecting
household current consumption. Your task is to create machine-learning
appliance detection, real-time data infrastructure and front-end
services that could minimise fossil fuel consumption across the whole
country, while keeping everyone happy through consensus pricing markets
and social media.
