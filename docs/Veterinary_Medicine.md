Like humans, dogs often suffer from injuries and problems in their
joints. But while medical research constantly collects data on treatment
and outcomes for humans, there is no data resource to monitor
postoperative recovery in small animals. A mobile phone app would allow
the dog carers to monitor progress of their dogs during recovery after
orthopaedic surgery, would provide information on what to expect, and
would allow dog carers to connect with their consultant easily and
efficiently. You have a chance to work with a leading veterinary
orthopaedic surgeon specialising in treatment of these conditions, with
the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for many
animals with this new form of remote patient support.
