Many charities rely on volunteer networks, but small local charities
sometimes don't have the staff to maintain those networks. On the flip
side, many people would like to volunteer to help a local charity but
aren't able to commit a set number of hours per week. Micro-volunteering
allows individuals to offer up their skills on an ad-hoc basis and for
charities to take advantage of that, and is extremely valuable to
smaller charities or community organisations. Your task is to design a
micro-volunteering exchange, that can match volunteers and their skills
to opportunities and needs in their local area. Locality is critical in
micro volunteering, perhaps a graph database (like neo4j) would be
interesting here. Remember also that skills and needs often involve
different terminology - how will your system understand that the skill
of "simple wiring jobs" should be matched to the need of "broken bulb in
shelter"?
