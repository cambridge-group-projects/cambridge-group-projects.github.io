Todayâ€™s personal bank accounts and banking apps all work by counting
money, a simple technology that was created centuries ago as a social
consensus to support trade. In the future, we are going to need a carbon
economy that realistically prices everything in relation to the actual
costs for the planet. Your task is to create a prototype of a new
banking system, including personal savings and payment apps, where every
transaction is based on the verified carbon cost of products and
services. Consensus on carbon costs should allow for initial estimated
quotes the first time a particular transaction is made, with better
calibrated scientific evidence funded by arbitrage to increase eventual
accuracy for integrity of the whole system.
