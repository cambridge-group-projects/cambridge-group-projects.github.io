The Terra API unlocks health and fitness data from diverse sources,
including popular wearables and fitness apps like Fitbit, Apple Watch,
Oura, and 70+ others. Your challenge is to leverage the Terra API to
develop an innovative and creative product that enhances the way people
engage with health and fitness data. We're looking for an application
that does more than track metrics. Your project needs to inspire,
motivate, and transform users' health and fitness journey.
