As autonomous vehicles become more common, we are likely to see people
tweaking algorithms to accelerate their journeys. Your task is to create
a competitive 'market' in which users can submit algorithms to see which
is the best. You'll need to define a simple scripting language and API
suitable for creating the entries. Users should be able to enter their
script into an interactive game then see its performance in a real-time
car race against other user's scripts. The best entries should be stored
and ranked in a leader board, with new players able to see existing code
and tweak it for better performance. In future, this kind of algorithm
market could be applied to other problem domains such as finance.
