The Barbican Rain Room was an artificial shower, digitally controlled so
you could walk around in it while never getting wet. Imagine if every
bicycle ride in Cambridge was programmed to be dry! Your goal is to use
advanced Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to extrapolate from open rain
radar data, finding precise windows when a specific bicycle journey can
be completed through dry corridors, even if itâ€™s raining all around.
Some high-end computation will be needed in the back-end, but the user
interface should be an intuitive rendering in a web browser.
