This briefing information is provided for potential client/mentors of
group design project teams.

## Preparation

We will work with you to define a reasonably open-ended one-paragraph
design brief, in a technical and business area that interests you. For
more information, see [What makes a good
project?](What_makes_a_good_project? "wikilink").

We collect potential project ideas in September or earlier, and the
design briefs are finalised in October. Projects are pitched to students
in November, after which they express their preferences. A few briefs
are usually cancelled at this stage.

## Kick-off

Students are assigned to projects, in teams of 5 or 6, at the start of
term in mid-January.

## Progress meetings

The group project course runs for 8 weeks, in January-March each year.
Client contact with the groups involves **four one-hour progress
meetings** in weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 of the project. Actual dates in the
current year are advertised in the course timetable:
<https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part-ib/group-projects/important-dates>

Note that clients are **not** required to attend the briefing lecture in
November or project kick-off session in January. They are welcome to
attend the public screening of the final video demonstrations and
prize-giving, or view these online, but this is not essential.

Each meeting is planned within a three-day period and the student group
is tasked with agreeing a meeting slot with you in that period. Meetings
can take place online, although students appreciate the opportunity to
meet their client in person, where this is convenient for you.

Please let us know if a student fails to come to a meeting. Attendance
is compulsory, and vigorously enforced. If a student does not turn up,
this is most often a welfare problem, so it is important that we learn
of it as soon as possible in order to get assistance from the student's
college.

## Deliverables, Resources and Ownership

During the project, the team will deliver a frozen version of working
documents by email to you on the day before the meeting. Email delivery
must be copied to the course administrators.

Although we use the term "client" to describe this mentoring
relationship, no payment is involved, and the projects involve no formal
transfer of intellectual property. Some further detail is provided in
the page on [Intellectual property](Intellectual_property "wikilink")

As an undergraduate course, the group projects do not have a research
budget for special equipment, compute resource or data licenses. We
therefore ask client companies to either loan or donate any specialist
resources necessary.

## Public demonstration

At the end of the term, groups are required to demonstrate their
achievements in pre-recorded videos, accompanied by a public
exhibition/demo session.

Presentations are followed by a vote, and the award of prizes to the
groups voted the best in three categories. We hope you are able to
participate, but it is not essential.

## Correspondence

Please send all official correspondence, especially notes on attendance
or other problems during the project, to group-project@cl.cam.ac.uk
.Email sent to this address is received by the course directors (for
projects in Lent term 2025, these are Alan Blackwell and Tobias
Grosser), and by the undergraduate student administrators (in 2024/25,
these are Becky Straw, Dean Dodds and Aidan Bishop)

## Assessment

The client is not required to assess or grade the students. It is
Computer Laboratory policy to award a flat mark (called a “tick”) for
adequate participation in a group project (actually four ticks – one
based on group performance, and three on performance of each individual
within the group). The standard of adequate performance is determined by
independent examiners, based on project documentation submitted by
students. Clients are simply requested to inform the course
administrators if any group member fails to attend, or seems unwilling /
unable to contribute to discussion. These precautions are mainly
motivated by concern for student welfare. Reports from the client are
not the sole grounds for withholding a tick, but students are told that
if they fail to attend meetings, this will jeopardize their chances of
getting the tick. It is important that we know this as soon as possible,
so that students can receive tutorial or pastoral support if necessary.

## Data Protection

We publish the name of the client, and keep these in an open public
archive as with academic publications. Personal details can be removed
from the archive on request, but please note that personal mentorship by
a named professional is an essential feature of the course.
