Open genomics provides an opportunity for members of the public to
engage directly with genomic health research including Genome-Wide
Association Studies (GWAS). Now that the emergency response phase of the
COVID pandemic is settling into management of endemic infections and
their consequences, there are many opportunities for members of the
public to contribute to such studies. The goal of this project is to
develop an interactive genome report that keeps members of the public
informed, and even allows them to participate as citizen scientists in
ongoing investigations of the many consequences of COVID.
