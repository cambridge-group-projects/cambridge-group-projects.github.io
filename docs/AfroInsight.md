AfroBarometer is a pan-African research network that collects public
attitude data on a variety of topics, including health. The World Health
Organization (WHO) is interested in using AfroBarometer data to inform
its global approaches to health information campaigns. However, the data
is currently in a proprietary format and can be difficult to access and
use, especially for non-technical users. Challenge: Develop a front-end
application that allows users to ask questions of AfroBarometer data in
a more intuitive and accessible way.
