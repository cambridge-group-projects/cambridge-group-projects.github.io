Touch screen prototyping at school

Secondary school design and technology teaching includes an emphasis on
inclusive design - creating products that are available for use by a
wider range of the population. At present, school students don't get to
learn about interactive software design, but they probably know that
products like touch-screen smart phones are a major obstacle for their
grandparents, and students should have a chance to learn about how to
improve matters! Your task is to create a low cost system for
prototyping new touch screen interfaces, that is sufficiently easy to
use that 12 and 13 year-olds can experiment with alternative phone
designs. The whole system should be sufficiently compact that it can be
deployed on a Raspberry Pi (we can supply large touch screens that can
be interfaced to the Pi).
