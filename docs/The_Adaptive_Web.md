Most websites are designed on the basis that “one size fits all” - for
any kind of user or context of use. Your task is to create a tool that
allows users to author their own policies for customised appearance and
behaviour, for example dark-mode viewing, text subsets, or controls
suited to elderly users or those with disabilities. It should also be
possible to apply data from one user-selected site (e.g. a weather
forecast) to customise the appearance of another. The configuration
process should be easily accessible to a wide range of users - so rather
than vendor-specific browser plug-ins, a more universal solution might
be a configurable online translation service that substitutes
alternative CSS and JavaScript through recipes that can be shared with
others. Such a powerful tool would also require security provision to
guard against misuse.
