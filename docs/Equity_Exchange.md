The crowd-funding proposition (e.g. Kickstarter) is simple - give us
your money, we’ll make a product. So is Mechanical Turk - do our menial
task, we’ll give you money. What about situations where everyone is
adding value, and the rewards should be shared (or negotiated) in
proportion? Many startups, indie video games, and social enterprises
work this way. Because there are no suitable online platforms for
negotiating and setting them up, at the moment everyone involved has to
live in the same place, whether Silicon Valley or Cambridge, to work it
out over endless macchiatos. Your task is to create an online service
that uses artificial intelligence approaches to help potential
co-founders form a team, and create a fair legal framework, financial
structure and investor/market engagement mechanisms. Software startups
would expect all of this to sit on top of a Github-style repository for
content and code, customised to their individual needs. If there is a
market here, you’re free to use the result to bootstrap your own
business!
