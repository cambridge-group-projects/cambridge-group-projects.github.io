# Replaced by [Locally Augmented Retail](Locally_Augmented_Retail "wikilink")

Client: Paul Bowes, Bacchanalia <Team@winegod.co.uk>

One of the group project coordinators has an excellent memory for wine,
but a poor memory for names. When he walks into Bacchanalia, his local
wine shop, he (like many other customers) often says "I'd like another
bottle of that tasty Pinot Grigio you sold me last week". Paul's
response is always the same: "It's my job to recommend the wine - it's
your job to remember it". A simple Android app could solve all our woes.
Satisfied wine drinkers just photograph the label, perhaps with a
tasting note to share with others. The app recognises the wine from the
label, and sends an email to Paul for later reference. This can link to
a reference site with notes of specific wines and regions each customer
likes, and even build up a taste profile for recommendations. If the
label recognition works well enough, it should be possible to point a
web cam at the shelves, automatically recording what wines are still in
stock, or automatically responding to urgent online queries in the
spirit of the Trojan Room coffee pot.

but it provides quite a lot of the features we discussed …
