The Citizens Advice Bureau is an organisation that helps people find
information relevant to problems in their lives. A major area of
activity is telephone advice consultations, at the end of which the
caller might be directed to a website with information leading to
assistance - for example, a family law practice or a social welfare
agency. Your goal is to create a service that might be more comfortable
for younger people, based on anonymous online chat rather than phone
lines. The goal isn't to make an intelligent chatbot, because human
contact is important to people with problems, but you could help make
the process more efficient, for example by directing either callers or
advisers to suitable parts of earlier conversations that seem relevant.
Remember that a simple Google search won't work here. People describe
their problems, not the answer they are looking for, and there are many
commercial websites that aim to exploit people with problems rather than
offer them neutral advice.
