Proposed project for 2021:

Clinical Nursing for Children

In wealthy countries, hospitals use complex clinical information systems
to capture and analyse data such as heart rate, respiration, oxygen
saturation, temperature etc. In countries like Myanmar, nurses working
in child healthcare have no access to computers that could be used to
monitor and chart the condition of multiple patients every 1-2 hours
over the course of their treatment. Your goal is to design a mobile app
that can be used to capture data, generate clinically relevant output
and empower nurses to escalate patient care as appropriate. Challenges
will include transferring data between shifts, protecting patient
confidentiality, and potentially integrating with existing apps.
