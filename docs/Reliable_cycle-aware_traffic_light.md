Most central Cambridge junctions snarl up at critical moments between
lectures, with accidents, broken limbs and worse as students jump red
lights after realising they are running late. Your task is to create a
fault-tolerant traffic light controller (using a pair of Raspberry Pis
with a hardware fail-over), that builds a traffic model based on weather
data, university building management systems, bus timetables, and any
other data sources that you can discover to accurately predict cycle
volumes. This database should be combined with traffic sensor data to
invent a new cycle-aware junction control model.
