Client: William Bakker, [IMC](IMC "wikilink") <William.Bakker@imc.com>

Escape Room facilities are popular for student social outings and
professional team building, but the props and decorations needed to
create an engaging theme are difficult to move from place to place. Your
task is to create an authoring tool for Hololens that can be used to
turn any physical space into an escape room, using only simple portable
apparatus. Using holographic projections, clues and puzzles should be
provided that the player must navigate in order to unlock the exit. The
Hololens can be connected to a screen to share the vision of the wearer
to the other players. IMC will provide one Microsoft Hololens.
