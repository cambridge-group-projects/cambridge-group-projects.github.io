Are you ever curious just how fast delivery riders and hacked e-scooters
travel down cycle paths? GPS-enabled apps like Strava can tell you how
fast you are going yourself, but not how fast somebody else is. In
principle, you could automate that. First record some precise reference
points on a cycle path of your choice. If planning an official
complaint, you might think how to secure that data for later
confirmation. Then you'll need some video with accurate timestamps to
verify the velocity as the rider's front wheel passes each point.
Finally, what is the most effective way to use the aggregated data to
campaign for better regulation, as an alternative to motorist campaigns
against cycle lanes?
