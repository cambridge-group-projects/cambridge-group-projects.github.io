Few children (or even adults) really understand what makes a password
secure, or how to keep their online information safe. Your task is to
create a simple set of password cracking and message
encryption/decryption tools that children can run on the Raspberry Pi,
together with a scripting language or GUI for them to run simple
statistical experiments to understand what factors make their messages
more secure. Children love code-breaking, so it should be easy to make
this into an entertaining Raspberry Pi game, not just boring school
work.
