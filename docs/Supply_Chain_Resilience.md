Events such as the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war highlight
inefficiencies in global supply chains, affecting our everyday lives
through energy prices, inflation, cost-of-living, unemployment and
housing. This project will use publicly available datasets and APIs to
build a comprehensive map investigating supply chain choices such as
semiconductors for tech via China to the West, oil exports, agricultural
product shipments etc. You will create metrics for supply chain
efficiency and resilience, ranging from route stability to sensitivity
to natural disasters. This visualisation should offer opportunities to
optimise routes for delivery of different industrial products,
contrasting and comparing CO2 emissions, cost, reliability, and
robustness through diversity of supply options. It will be important to
ensure that data is not biased, and that features are explainable, to
support public accountability for decision makers.
