Educational project suggestion on Raspberry Pi from Cecily Morrison
<cpm38@cam.ac.uk>

Step 1: Groups of students can model the spread of influenza and then
visualise it graphically on one screen or with sound/light across each
students RPi as they get infected.

Step 2: This model can be made more complicated by making the rules
relative to contact and therefore requiring sensing about where people
are moving in the room.

Step 3: Add interventions and see how it changes

Step 4: Get students to think of solutions (e.g. hand washing) and use
the RPi to monitor the amount of handwashing in a school through the use
of various sensing attachments. This could also be applied to any other
social networking problem if it is not winter.
