Interval training, where the user performs an exercise for a set time
before moving to the next, is increasingly popular but poorly supported
by technology. Your task is to produe a proof-of-concept system allowing
a user to easily create or download a workout schedule (“press ups for
20s, star jumps for 15s…”) on their phone and push it to a smartwatch
app that then leads them through the session using visual output and
haptics to indicate transitions. For those working out together we want
to synchronise their watches to make a better social experience.
