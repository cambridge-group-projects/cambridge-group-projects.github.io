Suggestion by Peter Robinson / Simon Moore

Current status: it seems unlikely that the EDSAC reconstruction project
will have a working chassis ready in time for group project public
demonstrations in March 2013. It may be necessary to defer this project
until 2014.

The pioneering Cambridge EDSAC computer is now being reconstructed at
the national computing museum(??). However, the radio valves, mercury
delay lines, and other components of EDSAC are all far less reliable
than modern technology. This means it will be a real challenge keeping
the thing running! Your task is to build an embedded diagnostic monitor
device, using Raspberry Pi, that can continuously monitor the health of
the reconstructed EDSAC, warning operators when something needs to be
fixed, or perhaps that it is about to fail. We expect there will be
multiple Raspberry Pi's in each chassis or frame of the EDSAC. They
might even be able to compensate for temporary failures, imitating the
behaviour of that chassis to keep the rest of the system working until a
failed component is replaced.
