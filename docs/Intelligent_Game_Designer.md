There has been a lot of recent publicity about the success of CST
alumnus Demis Hassabis' company Deep Mind, in creating an AI system that
can learn to play 1980s arcade games. Of course, there is not much
profit in playing computer games - the real business opportunity is
designing them! The goal of this project is to create a fully automated
AI system that can design original new levels of a casual game such as
Candy Crush Saga. There is an art in designing good levels - they should
be easy at first, get a lot harder, but be ultimately solvable. You will
need to construct a population of simulated players, at all different
levels of ability, to assess the quality of the levels generated. By
optimising simulated play, each level should be challenging, motivating,
while also being aesthetically pleasing.
