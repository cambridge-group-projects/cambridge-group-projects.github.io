Services such as Google Translate are a useful tool for global languages
like Mandarin or French, but many people in remote rural areas
contribute to public life in their own local languages. It's not
necessary to translate these, but it's useful for UNICEF and other
international agencies to know what general concerns these people share
with neighbouring regions. Cambridge organisation Africa's Voices has
datasets of SMS messages collected from different African countries, in
local languages, addressing shared health and human rights issues. Your
goal is to create a visual browser, perhaps in the style of word clouds,
that would allow international policy teams to explore topic maps
bringing multiple languages together. The LDA algorithm might be a
useful approach to topic map construction.
