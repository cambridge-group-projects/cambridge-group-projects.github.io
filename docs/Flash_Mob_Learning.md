School students increasingly use tablet or mobile devices to access
online content or submit work, but these depend on network
infrastructure. The goal of this project is to create a local content
hub that allows students and teachers to collaborate, but without
needing an internet connection (for example, in developing countries, in
rural locations, or just to avoid the bureaucracy of school internet
permissions). You will use a Raspberry Pi as the basis for a WiFi
hotspot that also has a built-in educational content platform, allowing
students themselves to collaborate in building the content. This could
support in-browser creation of shared executable scripts as provided by
skulpt.org, or even shared composition of a piece of digital music (see
sonic-pi.net) that would be played from a speaker on the central device.
