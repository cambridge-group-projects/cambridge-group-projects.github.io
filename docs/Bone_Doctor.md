Large databases of labelled X-ray images such as the MURA dataset of
broken bones can be used to train AI systems that provide medical
advice. An intelligent clinical assistant should be able to take a
previously unseen X-ray image and link it directly to cases that can
guide possible treatment. Your task is to train a neural network that
will find a variety of other cases that are clinically similar, but
visually distinct, presented in a visual overlay that highlights local
differences for a clinician to review.
