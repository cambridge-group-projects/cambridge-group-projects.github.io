UNEP-WCMC have been pioneering the development of an agent based model
of whole ecosystems, the Madingley model. This process based formulation
provides an engine that can be used in many ways. One of the key ways we
would like to use the model is to engage with the public and/or decision
makers. Your challenge is to consider options for improving the way the
model can be used, either through a game interface or a visualisation
interface for the model engine. The principal aim is to make the model
more engaging and exciting.
