Create a structured framework with a rudimentary graphical display which
allows the loading of scripted scenarios, consisting of environment
information, objects, targets, and properties, and also allows the
loading of externally authored ‘Bots’ to function and execute objectives
within the given environment.

The framework will offer these bots access via an API to information
about the environment and other bots within it. The purpose of the
application is to provide a workbench to trial different programmed
AI’s, and strategies to navigate to targets and achieve a goal, either
alone, as a crowd of either one type, or a mixture of different types of
bots.

At least two different examples of bot logic should be provided along
with the framework to demonstrate it’s functioning.
