Are VR-controlled vehicles the answer to postal woes? With e-commerce
pushing package-delivery services to the brink and self-driving cars not
yet available, we want to explore a new generation of remotely driven
vehicles. Your exciting task: build a service that controls a smart
vehicle (Lego Mindstorms EV3 Car with camera) using a VR headset
(Oculus). Optionally, you could broadcast the video output of the smart
vehicle to a web service.
