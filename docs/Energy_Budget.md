Shops don’t take your money without asking, so why should your home
appliances use scarce electricity resources without consulting you?
Current “smart meters” are pretty useless, because house occupants have
to guess where the power is going. Local company Informetis has an
Internet of Things device that sends a WiFi stream of power consumption
from any appliance. Your task is to make an app that will aggregate and
visualise this data to help households budget for a future where energy
costs 10 times what it does today. When energy is rationed, what will
work best? Neighbourhood contests, household policies, online games or
financial incentives? Your system design needs to address motivation,
not just monitoring.
