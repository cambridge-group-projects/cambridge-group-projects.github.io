The valuation of investments according to their expected future value is
a key part of our economy. Unfortunately, sometimes investment decisions
are made as joke or in the absence of a justified reason, as in recent
scandals over GameStop and Dogecoin. The goal of this project is to
create an alternative investment platform in which every trade is
securely associated with a reason for the valuation, including links to
public sources. Other investors should be able to make judgements based
on individual trends of the asset, overall markets trends and the
aggregated assessments of the reasons given, based on natural-language
processing methods, to help assess how serious the opportunity really is
(i.e. if associated risk of investment is justified by the reasons
given).
