Everyone knows that peer-reviewed publication is the gold standard for
scientific facts. But it is too slow for the millennial generation, who
prefer fresh opinions and data "verified" by Facebook likes, GitHub pull
requests, up-votes, blog comments or TED talks. We need a new model for
science that is agile and open, but also solid enough to last another
500 years. Your task is to prototype the next Royal Society or Cambridge
University Press, providing democratic public access for millenials,
rapid quality control that would satisfy the next Isaac Newton, and PDF
for permanent paper archives to survive the Apocalypse of 2499. Elegance
and attention to detail are critical on both paper and screen - if it
looks like Buzzfeed, nobody will believe it was the Transactions of the
Royal Society. Don't forget the essential academic attributes of
accurate and secure certificates for time, authorship, and reference to
prior work.
