Surprisingly satisfying music can be defined in terms of in terms of
simple regular grammars. Simple regular grammars can be derived from
observing the traversal of a graph. Your task is to make a system that
automatically generates original music, according to rules that are
derived from the path of visitors walking through the formal garden at
Madingley Hall (http://goo.gl/maps/9utLI). A small number of infrared
detectors hidden in the flowerbeds will detect people passing. A
Raspberry Pi should use these signals to create a grammar that can also
be viewed and modified by members of the public, in the form of source
code that can be edited from any web browser via an HTTP server on the
Raspberry Pi. Of course, everyone should be able to hear the resulting
music, whether played over speakers in the garden, or by remote viewers
from their browsers. As an example of the kind of generative music that
might result, check out the video of Dave Griffiths' techno music
composing robots in al-jazari.
