It is often hard to “read” people in social gatherings. But virtual
reality can help us understand the relationship between different
personalities and social situations. Your task is to create a virtual
reality environment, in which people can create models of their
perceived self, using abstract objects of various shapes, colours and
sizes to mimic how their self-perception changes under various
influences. You might consider aspects of the five-factor model of
personality, to assess how these are affected by the personality of
other people in the same space. The result will be a new kind of social
gathering, allowing people to meet and interact without the guessing
games that are usually necessary to interpret body language and subtle
social cues. You might add ways to model other individuals, showing how
our personal observations differ from other people’s models of
themselves, and shape the data to deliver meaningful trends and
conclusions to sociologists.
