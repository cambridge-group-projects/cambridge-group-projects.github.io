Slightly crazy suggestion by Alan:

Humans are still better at making real world decisions than robots are -
self-driving cars are notoriously bad at judging novel situations. The
concept for this project is to use an abstract version of a real-world
scene to collect and aggregate judgments from millions of users. Using
the game mechanics of Candy Crush Saga, take the pixels from some part
of a real-world image (say a blurry traffic light or road sign), and
give prizes when large numbers of players agree on which action is
best - left, right, go or stop. Player motivation can be increased by
rendering the pixels as candy, so players don't feel they are being
exploited, but individual intelligence will be aggregated by an
algorithm that applies the results back to real images - perhaps by
training a neural network.
