Minecraft is practically a training simulator for environmental
destruction - open cast and strip mines, deforestation, large scale
industrial development and more. Your task is to use an open source game
engine such as Godot to prototype a new kind of game in which players
(re)build a natural world rather than destroying it. Rewards and metrics
can be related to biodiversity, species conservation, and re-wilding.
Sustainable social dynamics and economies might also be an important
factor. The challenge is to keep it exciting, but with thrills that
donâ€™t come from killing and maiming.
