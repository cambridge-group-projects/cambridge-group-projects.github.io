Client: Ana Cuza, ClimateInColour <anacuza@umich.edu>

There are many Spotify playlists featuring the sound of nature, but it's
hard to visit the places those sounds were recorded, or meet the people
that live there. This project is an environmental update on music
artists who make more money from concert visits and merchandise than
they do from streaming licenses. Your client has been working with a
forest community in Ghana, where the environmental soundscape doesn't
bring any revenue to the village. The goal is to create a geolocated
mobile app and business model, connecting distinctive sounds to new
revenues from ecotourism.
