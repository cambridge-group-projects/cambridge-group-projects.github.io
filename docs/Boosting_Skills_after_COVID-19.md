Digital Boost is an online learning platform to help people who work for
small businesses and charities to be mentored in ‘all things digital’,
to enable them to come out of the COVID-19 crisis stronger. A 46-part
taxonomy of skills currently covers 12,000 courses from 6 different
providers. Your challenge is to create an intelligent navigation and
guidance tool that creates a unique journey for each person, using
multiple sources of information to build a model of that person's needs
and experience, and drawing on opportunities for mentoring, workshops,
short courses and other resources as appropriate to their needs.
