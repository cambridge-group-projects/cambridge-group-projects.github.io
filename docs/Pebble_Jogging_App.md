We would like you to make a hazard warning app on the smartwatch Pebble.
When a user takes their Pebble for a jog, he/she can record GPS location
and details of any potential hazard they come across on the road, such
as broken pavement, dog dirt, flooding... After the run, they can pair
their Pebble to a computer program or mobile app, and upload the data
via an interactive map. This allows other Pebble users to download the
data, and receive an alarm when they are near the hazard. The relatively
constrained set of controls on the Pebble, and the constraint that the
jogger will want to work quickly before cooling down, means that you
will need to provide a intelligent text entry method.
