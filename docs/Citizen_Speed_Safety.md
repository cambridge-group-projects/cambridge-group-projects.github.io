Many small communities are endangered by drivers ignoring speed limits
and driving at high speed through populated areas. Some “speed trap”
apps are available for mobile phones, but these are inaccurate. It would
be possible to increase accuracy by using two phone cameras, one pointed
along the road, and the other across it. Computer vision processing is
needed to extract speed data from two time-stamped videos, and construct
a calibrated 2D model of the road, vehicle speed, and licence plate
number, which can be forwarded to local enforcement agencies together
with verified witness testimony.
