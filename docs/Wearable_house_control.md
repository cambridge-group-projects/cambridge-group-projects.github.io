In recent years, smart IOT hardware has become mainstream and
affordable. Common household devices include smart lights, sound
systems, curtains or thermostats. In principle, a smart hub allows
home-owners to control all of these. However, logging in to websites and
control apps is more of a pain than just using light switches. Your goal
is to provide integrated control from a wearable device (Android smart
watch provided), that can be used to customises all functions in a room
according to the combination of people present. At the least, the system
should switch on the lights if one person is there, but it should also
be programmable (or learn preferences and priorities) for music,
privacy, temperature etc.
