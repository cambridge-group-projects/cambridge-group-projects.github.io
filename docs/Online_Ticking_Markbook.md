We have various systems in use to administer ticks, from paper to custom
systems  Students need a single place to view all their pending and
awarded ticks, and DoSes need a view of their students’ progress. There
also needs to be a simple interface to requesting an extension and
getting the relevant approvals (DoS, then department). Your task is to
build a web-based system that can be used to bulk upload ticks either
manually or from an automated ticker, presenting the right information
to the right people, and allowing individual edits from authenticated
individuals.
