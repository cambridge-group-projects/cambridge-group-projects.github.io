National wellbeing is the aggregate of the population mood, but it's
difficult to know whether mood estimates are accurate or not. In fact,
even individuals find it difficult to estimate how their mood has
changed over time. The goal of this project is to automatically estimate
a number of factors that effect national mood - news, weather, economic
indicators - and aggregate these with personal mood estimates measured
via your mobile phone's sensors. These could include movement or
orientation data (facing into the wind?), feeds from a Facebook profile,
or other data. If users are unsure what mood they are in, they can check
their phone. And a longitudinal graph might help to review the year, or
forecast important mood transitions - like when the end of term is
approaching.
