Landing a plane using the instrument landing system (ILS) requires
regular practice to keep the necessary skills up to date. Unfortunately,
it's expensive and inconvenient for amateur pilots to get ILS landing
slots so they can practice. The goal of this project is to simulate ILS
using the GPS capabilities of a mobile phone, so that pilots can
practice their ILS skills even during a normal landing. The phone screen
should simulate actual ILS instruments when the plane is descending. You
may need to think about how to test this system without access to a
plane and airport - perhaps by providing descent guidance to cyclists
coming into town down Castle Hill?
