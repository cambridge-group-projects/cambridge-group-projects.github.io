New hospital treatments often involve as much computer imaging as they
do scalpels. Local company Cydar manages high volumes of images and
video data in the cloud using Amazon Web Services, and can even track
real-time video from an operating theatre, but configuring those data
flows is time-consuming and confusing. Your goal is to create a video
cloud service management tool inspired by Stuart Taylor's VPlay system
for live video remixing (http://vimeo.com/2738692). Users should be able
to review and modify the data flow architecture on AWS virtual machines,
while also getting a live view of the current streams and archive
content to see where the problems might be.
