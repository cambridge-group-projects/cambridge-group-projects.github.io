Many kinds of domestic robot and home appliances rely on small motors
that have an unknown time to failure. Your task is to create a
monitoring system that uses voltage and current profile to predict
number of cycles until a failure. This should be offered as an online
service that can be used by the homeowner to order spare parts, or a
contract maintenance company responsible for keeping the household
running without hitches. The project will involve testing a number of
motors to destruction in order to build machine learning prediction
profiles.
