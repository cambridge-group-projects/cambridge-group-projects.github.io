They want a bit more time to think, so may return to this in 2019

The British Trust for Ornithology wants to improve public engagement
with bird conservation. One very successful approach is to help those
interested in wild birds to learn more about their daily activities, and
to imagine the environments that the birds have to survive in. The goal
of this project is to create a game that runs on a mobile phone
platform, allowing players to compare their own movements to those of
cuckoos, as tracked by BTO. You are free to design a game scenario in
any genre that makes use of player location data and cuckoo tracking
data.
