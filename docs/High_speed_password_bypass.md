Many companies ask users to create a unique user account and password
for systems whose security the user couldn't care less about. Sometimes
it can be faster to just click "forgot my password", and use the emailed
reset link rather than the login page. Your task is to make a super-fast
login bypass procedure by automating this process, with a custom
web/email client that will automatically trigger the forgotten password
facility in any URL it receives, then take care of the reset process
(using the user's securely stored email account credentials) to navigate
the login process without having to bother with inventing a real
password.
