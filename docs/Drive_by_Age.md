It is often difficult for young people on the roads to remember that
older people (such as the Group Project Coordinators) see the world very
differently - sensitivity to light decreases dramatically, while
reaction times, awareness of peripheral movement, distance vision,
hearing and fine motor control can also change a great deal. Your task
is to make a driving simulator that allows a user to drop through from
Google Maps into an alternative interactive Street View as experienced
by an older person driving a car. You should simulate particularly
challenging situations such as night-time with cyclists having dark
clothes and no lights. It should be possible to see any neighbourhood in
the UK, from the perspective of a wide range of different ages, and with
the experience as realistic as possible. You could even control the
simulation on the basis of local demographic data, so that popular
retirement destinations can be seen from the point of view of their
residents.
