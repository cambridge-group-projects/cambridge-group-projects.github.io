Even the best conferences and conventions experience a slump where
engagement declines. Your job is to design and prototype a mobile AR
experience to keep conference attendees interested - using gamification
and social techniques to bring attendees together, predict and counter
the slump, as well as providing a novel way to deliver key information
about the event. This should be offered as a downloadable app that
supports the 2019 public show for the group projects, and also shows the
potential to support RuneFest 2019, the JAGEX convention thatâ€™s all
about RuneScape.
