In the future, we’ll all have barcodes tattooed on our foreheads, but
until then, it would be very helpful if Google Glass could recognise
your friends (or enemies) by some kind of visual code that doesn’t look
quite so apocalyptic. Your task is to create some kind of unique visual
ID that can be applied to a face localised within an image, giving
feedback to the Glass wearer such as what bands or sports teams you
follow, what kind of beer they should buy you, or so on. The Viola-Jones
face tracker can identify faces within an image, so from this starting
point, you should work out what kind of coloured dots, stripes, or other
decorations would uniquely identify any person in (say) your College.
