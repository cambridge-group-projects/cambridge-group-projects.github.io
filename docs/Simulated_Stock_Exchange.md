Almost all stock trading is now done by algorithms. Early profits have
reduced, and algo-trading strategies must adapt quickly to the changing
economic environment, market movements and technological advancement.
The most common way to evaluate a new strategy is to “back-test” it
against historical market moves, which has the benefit of being based on
real data but doesn’t predict how the market will react to the
introduction of a new strategy. The aim of the project is to build an
online platform to allow competitive testing of algos on a shared
simulated exchange with both historical and live market data. The
platform will provide an API to access market data and issue orders to
the exchange. The user-developed algos will compete against each other
interactively and a reporting service will display the analysis of the
relative profitability of each strategy and track the best algorithms on
a leaderboard. Students will be provided with an algo pseudo code and
examples of sources of market data
