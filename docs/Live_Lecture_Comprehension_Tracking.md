Lecturing a large group is a challenging task, not least because there
are few feedback cues: how much of the room is understanding? Too fast?
Too slow? Your task is to develop a system that provides a feedback
loop. Firstly, it should allow students to rate their current
comprehension of lecture material through a mobile app, displaying the
aggregated results live as a distribution in a corner of the presented
screen. Secondly, the app should allow students to submit questions
anonymously that, once upvoted to a preset level, flash up on the
screen.
