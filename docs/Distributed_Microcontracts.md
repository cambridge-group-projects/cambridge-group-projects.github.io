Personal and small business finance innovations increasingly come from
low-income countries, as with the hugely successful M-Pesa mobile
payment system. The goal of this project is to create a distributed
payment and ledger system for organisations that commission many small
pieces of work in remote locations. These contracts can often be passed
on or subcontracted, making them hard to trace. Your system should use
the sensor capabilities of smartphones (e.g. camera, accelerometer, GPS)
to authenticate contracts, payment and verification of commissioned work
in an intuitive, secure and traceable way.
