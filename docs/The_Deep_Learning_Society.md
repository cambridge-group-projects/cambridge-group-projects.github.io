Technology companies invest billions in self-driving cars and
self-playing computer games, but surprisingly little in real social
problems. Your task is to use the latest deep learning technologies to
create an intelligent social work assistant that can recognise and act
in situations of real need. Your client will provide a GPU-accelerated
system suitable for use with deep learning frameworks like Google
TensorFlow. You will train it using data from online social networks
such as MumsNet, to recognise and anticipate situations where people are
going to use words like “hopeless”, “depressed” or “suicide". With the
help of deep learning, even a simple Bag of Words, together with
metadata such as time of day, location and comment feedback will be
sufficient to recognise trigger conditions in large data sets and
mobilise assistance.
