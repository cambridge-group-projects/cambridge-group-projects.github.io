The Raspberry Pi is cheap enough that it could be used instead of
instruments in a school orchestra. Each one needs a small speaker, but
not necessarily a screen - either a mouse or keyboard can control sound
synthesis. If some devices had screens, they could be used to "conduct"
(via a shared network clock signal, with tempo variations as
appropriate), or even distribute code for remote execution elsewhere. A
technical approach to synthesising good quality sound can build on the
source code for the recently released Sonic Pi, and networking ideas can
be borrowed from international laptop orchestras (PB_UP offers code
distribution):
