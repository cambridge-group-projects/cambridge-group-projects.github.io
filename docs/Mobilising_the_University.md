Many University systems used by Cambridge students can be extended using
the new UIS API Gateway service, including location and access
facilities that are currently delivered via the University Card, but
which could in future be accessed via NFC authentication from the
studentâ€™s phone. The goal of this project is to create a new student
arrival experience, delivered via a phone app that integrates their
official physical access to Cambridge with administrative onboarding and
the online knowledge resources of the University.
