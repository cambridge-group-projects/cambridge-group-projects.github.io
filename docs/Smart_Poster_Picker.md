Many people like to buy poster reproductions of famous artworks. This
could be done by using a mobile phone to take a picture of the painting
they would like to hang on their wall, and sending an MMS message to a
poster distribution service. Design a system that retrieves and ranks
probable matching candidates from a database of posters, based on a
mobile phone image. A simple metric for matching might be the relative
averages or variances of hue in each quadrant of the image. Where the
photo is not good enough to provide an effective match, users should
also be able to navigate through thumbnails of the available posters,
arranged according to the match metric for aesthetic graphical
navigation.
