Direct action can be an effective contribution to our preparations for
the future. However, with limited resources in volunteer organisations,
it is important to target action toward the problems that have greatest
benefit for the environment. The goal of this project is to use public
information such as traffic monitoring and air quality data to help
activists deliver most value to public thinking and government policy. A
useful direct action coordination app could take account of public
opinion, availability of activist volunteers, and measurement of
environmental data to maximise the benefit to society of such
organisations.
