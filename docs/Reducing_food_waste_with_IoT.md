15 million tonnes of food are thrown away every year in UK alone and
almost 50% of this comes from our homes. It seems likely that Internet
of Things (IoT) devices, mobiles and wearables could be used to detect
and avoid some causes of this problem, for example by sharing surpluses
or reducing stockpiles by sharing “buffers” of food between neighbours.
Your task is to recover some traditions of sharing food among
neighbours, with a community platform that enhances social connections
through sharing food. Your client will provide a prototype of one novel
IoT device - “Spare Bite” (www.sparebite.com), but you should also
consider the ways that other connected devices may contribute - iPads
used in the kitchen for online references, or even the infamous Internet
Fridge.
