Routine financial responsibilities can be more pleasant if a small
amount of chance is involved, for example UK Premium Bonds, which
distribute interest as monthly prizes with an average rate of return
comparable to other government-backed investments. This project aims to
create a personal finance game in which housemates (or larger groups)
can exchange transactions. When you spend money, the transaction will be
charged to some random member(s) of the group - possibly split. An
important constraint is that you should never be charged more money than
you would otherwise have spent in a given period (tunable by either you
or the group). Design suitable rules and build a UI and transaction
recording system that allows people to play this game.
