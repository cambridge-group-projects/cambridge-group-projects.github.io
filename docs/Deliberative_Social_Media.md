EngagementHQ is a software platform designed for public engagement and
debate, which was used alongside Zoom for recent research during the
\#LockdownDebate project. But in recent times, governments are having to
move faster and faster, while the large audiences on social media
struggle to engage in relevant ways. Your goal is to create a media
platform that is as engaging as TikTok, but also allows thoughtful
deliberation when different generations and communities have to share
their perspectives and make compromises on difficult questions, even
while government policy might be changing on a daily basis.
