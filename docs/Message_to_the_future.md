There are so many things that only happen once a year - birthdays, start
of term, insurance renewals - if only your email system could remember
what you did last year, and take care of it next time! Your job is to
implement an email server @nextyear, that will interpret the content of
any message it receives, work out which things will have to change next
year, and then draft an automatic update. It would be safer if this went
to the user for checking a few days in advance, and provided a web
interface to review currently active processes, but everything should be
achieved with the absolute minimum of mouse clicks or wasted user
attention
