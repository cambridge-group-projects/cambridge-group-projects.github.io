Idea for 2020:

Auntie Iris (AI)

Client: Vaiva Kalnikaitė, Dovetailed

Morality and ethics are concepts created by people. However, people are
not always inclined to behave in ethical ways. Much of the debate around
the fast development of AIs has focussed on ensuring that machine
learning systems are designed ethically and make decisions that do not
result in harm to any. These debates assume that people are the
authority on ethics and morality. In an ironic twist, your task is to
build an AI that functions as an ethical consultant or agony aunt to its
end users. Much like an interaction with an agony aunt, the system
should take on a conversational dynamic, with the user asking a question
for which the AI has a witty and philosophical response to.
