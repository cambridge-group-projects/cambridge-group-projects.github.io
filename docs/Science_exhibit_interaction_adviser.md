The newly established Cambridge Science Centre is building a major
interactive public science exhibition space in Cambridge. We want this
to be the best of its kind in the world! One issue faced by interactive
science exhibits is the tendency for visitors to play with the knobs and
handles in a random way, without the guidance that might make the
discovery experience more enjoyable and educational. The goal of this
project is to make a configurable exhibit monitor (delivered via an
embedded Raspberry Pi), that will prompt visitors to explore behaviours
they haven't yet seen. This should have a simple authoring language
associated with it (perhaps configured via a flow chart) that describes
possible exploration paths, and allows a scientific adviser or exhibit
designer to tag those that appear to be off-topic, incomplete or
unhelpful. Configuration and review of interaction statistics should be
available remotely, via a network connection to each exhibit equipped
with one of these devices.
