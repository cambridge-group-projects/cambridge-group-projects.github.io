Many areas of life such as housing, health, education and employment are
subject to gender, racial and other biases that can be detected with
machine learning classification systems. Your task is to identify
potential bias in personal documents such as a CV, health record or
university application, and then to use a generative neural network
approach to tweak these documents (perhaps by adjusting text or
selectively removing information) so that they cannot clearly be
classified. The algorithm should be packaged in an interactive tool that
allows people to write ambiguated personal documents, and also
highlights and educates them about the sources of bias.
