Google Scholar is a good way to find scientific results, but it only
reads the words - not actual data. The goal of this project is to create
document analysis algorithms that can automatically identify and
describe graphs of scientific data - something like "find a graph where
blood pressure decreases with age". Users should be able to feed in
complete HTML or PDF documents, which are automatically parsed for graph
content, and stored in an archive that supports sophisticated data
queries and comparisons between graphs in different documents.
