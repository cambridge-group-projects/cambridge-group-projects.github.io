The Raspberry Pi is an ideal platform for kids to learn more about
computing with sound and video by working in social groups. Create a
system that will allow a number of people in the same or different
locations to play instruments of the Indonesian gamelan, producing a
single music performance that can be heard by each of them. If a player
needs to take a break,they can set their session to a robot mode, in
which the appropriate notes are played at the right times relative to
other players. Note that relative timing of the event streams, even in
the case where no robots are playing, is likely to be a hard problem!
