Over-the-counter (OTC) trading of financial products is less regulated
than exchange trading, but also less transparent. To improve market
fairness and efficiency, near-realtime details of OTC trades must
therefore be placed in a public repository
(rtdata.dtcc.com/gtr/dashboard.do). However, since this data is not easy
to view and analyse, the aim of increased transparency has not been
achieved. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient means of
accessing, viewing and analysing OTC trade data. This should provide
realtime data on current prices and trading volumes, historic trends,
and automated identification of pricing anomalies and trend alerts.
