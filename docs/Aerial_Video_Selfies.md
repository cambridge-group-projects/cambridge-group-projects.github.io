A recent viral video of a guy singing the Fleetwood Mac song Dreams,
while skateboarding down the road, was swiftly followed by a similar
video from Mick Fleetwood himself. But isn't it a bit dangerous for 73
year-olds to be filming themselves like that? Your task is to design a
drone control system that follows a planned camera path while
maintaining focus on a moving person, taking good quality aerial
close-up video as they skateboard, bicycle, or just walk. It would be
particularly impressive to use information like bluetooth signals and
computer vision to automatically recognise and follow even an unplanned
path. The result would be great for sports coverage, and could even be
the future of mobile Zoom.
