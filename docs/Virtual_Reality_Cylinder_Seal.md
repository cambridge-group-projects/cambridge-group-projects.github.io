Cylinder seals, as used by the Babylonians, are beautiful things. They
are carved with the inverse of a linear design, so that when rolled
across wet clay they will create a strip relief. But they are hard to
create, because they involve making an inverse carving. With modern
technology, we could carve a cylinder seal by looking outward from the
inside, carving the surface around the 360 degrees of the cylinder, but
working from underneath the surface. In this project you will create
software tools to allow an Oculus Rift user to carve a cylinder seal
from the inside, then generate the input to a 3D printer that will make
the actual cylinder.

Idea arose from a discussion with Fred Baker. He wants to use it himself
in a film production proposal, and wants to retain all intellectual
property in the idea of using cylinder seals in virtual reality, so not
suitable for group project at this stage.
