I am very keen to submit a project for next year and I already have some
ideas that I think would work well within the context of the project
space.

Alan's suggestion:

Machine Learning to Brain Surgery

Your client has worked with surgeons at Addenbrookes to create a
national database of brain surgery, recording every “cerebral shunt”
operation in the country. Straightforward unsupervised machine learning
methods could be used to cluster the records in this database, and
advise trainees or even experienced surgeons in the operating theatre.
Your goal is to make a tablet or mobile app that could be deployed in an
operating theatre, presenting intelligent advice about the current
patient as decisions are taken - is this surgery likely to be typical
for this surgeon, or this hospital, or have unusual factors been
detected? Your solution must be secure as well as smart, because NHS
patient data is carefully protected.

Suggestion from 2016 that did not proceed:
