Model-Based Design (MBD) is a prevalent methodology that is used in
complex control, signal processing and communication systems to address
problems that arise during their design. Engineers in, for example,
aerospace and automotive industries use MBD to define models that have
advanced functional capabilities by pictorially combining well-defined
building blocks and describing communication between them. Unfortunately
school children are not exposed to MBD at an early age and as a result
do not grasp how engineering is made enjoyable and rewarding by
tinkering with combinations and communications between building blocks.
Your task is to design a light-weight interface that can run directly on
Raspberry Pi that will enable school children to write applications that
can seamlessly use the underlying hardware and peripherals connected to
the Raspberry Pi. You will need to identify basic building blocks that
will make school children interested in your interface and are powerful
enough to create applications that a child's mind may envision. Finally,
you should be able to demonstrate how easy it is to create an
application using your interface that is eye catching, such as tracking
the movement of a yellow duck toy.
