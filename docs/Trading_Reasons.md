The valuation of commodities and investments according to their expected
future value is a key part of our economy. Unfortunately, some people
damage this system for a joke, as in recent scandals over GameStop and
Dogecoin. The goal of this project is to create an alternative
investment platform in which every trade is securely associated with a
reason for the valuation, ideally with links to public sources. Other
investors should be able to make judgements based on aggregated
assessments of the reasons given, based on natural-language processing
methods, to help assess how serious the opportunity really is, and
whether they want to risk their own money for the same reasons.
