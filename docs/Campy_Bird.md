Flappy bird is possibly the least intelligent video game ever made. But
similar game mechanics could perhaps be used to automatically acquire
more useful habits, for example if a whole class full of kids learns to
take correct actions together, as part of a class activity. Your task is
to design a whole-class education app, in which the players can only
finish if everyone learns together how to avoid infection from
campylobacter - a bacterium commonly found in the food chain that causes
22,000 hospitalisations and 110 deaths in the UK each year. The whole
class has to guide a new-born chicken as it travels from farm to fork,
taking rapid decisions based on what they have learned. One wrong step
by any pupil, and campy bird will educate the whole class further. Think
hard about motivation, or else the result may not be as entertaining as
we hope!
