The digital currency Bitcoin uses a block chain distributed database to
guarantee that any transaction can be traced to a unique original coin.
The same technique could be used for anonymous authentication of a chain
of custody for other kinds of data. Your task in this project is to
create a secure end-to-end system for authenticated reporting and
verification of organised criminal activity, corporate safety
violations, governmental human rights abuses etc. You need to think
about how reports can get into the system safely, and how those
receiving a report can use the block chain to prove that the evidence
has not been tampered with, all without endangering the whistleblower.
