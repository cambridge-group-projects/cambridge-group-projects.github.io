We think the Oculus Rift can be used to navigate complex and correlated
financial data using virtual reality. Your goal is to integrate time
series data on global futures, stocks, bonds and currencies with trader
sentiment and pin point market moving trades. The team will be provided
with time series data from Eurostoxx, DAX, CAC, KOSPI, Nikkei, ES,
EUR/USD, T-Note, GBL, etc. The VR interaction module should allow users
to look and left and right to see the past and future, nod forward and
back to zoom in and out for more detail. Other movements, such as
leaning to the left or right, could be used to select data sets or
analyses.
