The University's Museum of Zoology (UMZC) stores over two million
specimens, were collected over 200 years by naturalists including
Charles Darwin. Their age means most could not be electronically
catalogued at the time of their collection so many had their details
transcribed by hand into physical log books, inaccessible to most
audiences. Your task is to use optical character recognition and machine
learning to transcribe the notebook of one individual into an electronic
database or spreadsheet. This may involve going behind the scenes and
viewing collections usually inaccessible to the public.
