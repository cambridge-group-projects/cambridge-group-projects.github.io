Large-scale software development projects are often developed by
multiple contributors. In certain open-source projects, such as
compilers, operating systems or many HPC workloads, developers are
frequently located in different parts of the world and are affiliated
with various institutions. As a result, these developers may have
limited opportunities for direct interaction and must understand code
written by others without being able to easily discuss or ask questions
to the original authors. Your task is to utilize modern AI technology,
particularly large language models (LLMs), to develop a Code Explain AI
Assistant. This tool should be capable of providing explanations of
specific portions of code, generating helpful code comments, and even
answering more advanced queries to help developers navigate and
understand the codebase. The tool's applicability can be demonstrated
with popular open-source weather or climate codes, such as FV3 or
CLOUDSC.
