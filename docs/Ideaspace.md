The following invitation was passed on to Ben for 2021 and 2022

The Cambridge Computer Science Department runs an annual design project
course for its students, where teams of 6 develop a prototype for an
external client. No payment is required, but clients are expected to
meet with the team (by Zoom) four times between January and March. This
is a great opportunity to explore new product or application ideas, meet
skilled students who are interested in your business, or experiment with
new software technologies at minimal cost. If you would like to be
involved in the course next year, please contact the organisers on
group-project@cl.cam.ac.uk
