Proposed to Christopher Newfield <chris.newfield@isrf.org>

You may have noticed that many roads in Cambridge are not in good
repair. How are decisions made, on the mathematical relationship between
the weight of a car or lorry and how much it wears the road surface, the
seasonal and climate factors in repairing potholes, the cost of treating
an undergraduate cyclist for a broken arm in A&E, or the economic impact
of a change to their final degree class? Heterodox economic modelling is
a strategy for considering all the relevant factors, rather than being
driven by culture wars that distract political debate from the reality
of physics. Your task is to create a model that can be used to plan road
network changes in a way that optimises all social factors, not just the
result of the next general election.
