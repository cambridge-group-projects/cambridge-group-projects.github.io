Collecting accurate data about materials entering and leaving a
construction site is essential to ensure minimal waste and
climate-responsible behaviour. However, most of the available
information arrives on paper documents or pdf receipts. Optical
character recognition helps identify what is written on the tickets, but
the challenge is reliably identifying actionable information like
arrival times, certifications, and especially key data that has \*not\*
been captured. Your task is to create a phone app that can instantly
capture and advise drivers and gate staff, while populating a dashboard
that can be presented to local residents on a public display.
