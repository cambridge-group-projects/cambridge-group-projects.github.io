Proposed by Raoul-Gabriel Urma <rgu20@cam.ac.uk>

I have a fun proposal that would combine raspberry pie, robotics &
mobile programming.

Essentially the students would have to build a remote controlled
cocktail machine like this one:

during Friday's happy hour.

I think it could be challenging for the following reasons:

- build a system that takes orders from mobile phones (with a queue
  system)
- processes a big list of recipe from the internet (crawling)
- programming with raspberry pie and electronic components

There's even a startup who presented at techcrunch disrupt that is
trying to do something similar: <http://monsieur.co/>
