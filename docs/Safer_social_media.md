Young people with learning disabilities such as Down's Syndrome, ADHD or
dyslexia are increasingly excluded from social media opportunities. Your
goal in this project is to create a new front end for Facebook (using
the Facebook API) to provide a straightforward set of social functions
optimised for users who have very limited ability to use text in any
form. Rather than the single-user mode of typical Facebook usage, it is
also likely that a parent or carer may need to assist or review
interactions. Your design should take account of this in a sensitive
manner, including considerations of privacy and vulnerability.
