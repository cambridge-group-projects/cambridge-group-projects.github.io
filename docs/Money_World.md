UK voters are quite accustomed to seeing good quality visualisations of
economic data, tax and public expenditure. But these aren't accessible
in many parts of the world having low literacy, or where the only
internet access is via the mobile network. Your task is to create an app
that will run on a low cost Android phone, not using too much bandwidth,
that allows developing world users to visualise, share and comment on
economic data. Initiatives such as Gapminder, Africa's Voices and the
Open Data Initiative might provide a starting point for design ideas,
but you'll need to think about what information sources are both useful
to developing world users and publicly available -
www.globalintegrity.org is one organisation with the right kind of
focus. You could consider designs based on the Mo Ibrahim Foundation
indices, or even allowing citizens to see how their country compares to
others on the Millennium Development Goals. Keep in mind that the kinds
of visualisation suitable on a small screen will be very different to
what might appear on a newspaper site. JavaScript visualisation
libraries might come in handy, for example using a platform like
PhoneGap. In any case, users should be able to find out how the
visualisation was derived from the data, so that people in other
countries can share, reuse or extend it.
