Maker and hacker communities like the hundreds of thousands of Raspberry
Pi users need illustrated tools to explain tricky techniques or give
introductory tutorials. Those tools can also be used to tell mashed-up
stories based on other content - the huge expansion of Minecraft videos
on YouTube is one example. The goal of this project is to create a tool
that can grab any kind of content from a Raspberry Pi screen, allow
users to edit that content with added text, voice-over or drawn
annotations, and publish it via a forum in the style of
www.instructables.com
