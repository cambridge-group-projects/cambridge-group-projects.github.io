Everybody has a different approach to organising email and documents,
but nobody has time to do it properly. Your challenge is to create a new
kind of mail-plus client that uses unsupervised machine learning
techniques to help run a small business. It should recognise clusters of
email that the user can deal with as a batch, using the IMAP protocol to
create and populate archive folders on the mail server, or (if feeling
brave) automatically reply to them. Since much email content simply
repeats existing documents (whether as attachments or with repeated
text), your system should also scan for valuable data that is \*not\* in
the email archive - for example as disk files or on the local network.
These ought to be archived too, and somehow associated with relevant
email. But take care not to waste space by backing up too many similar
copies - prioritise information that seems to be important and unique.
