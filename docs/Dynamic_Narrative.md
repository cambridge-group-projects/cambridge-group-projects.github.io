Narrative-led games like Telltale’s The Walking Dead and The Wolf
Amongst Us present the player with a multilinear narrative driven by a
decision-based game engine. Your goal is to take this to the next level,
where the player can play several characters that have all experienced
the same event, and do this in any sequence. Each decision will have an
impact on the game’s visuals, positioning of props and dialogue options.
The focus should be on delivering a system architecture and tools that
allow developers to track the logic of player decisions and alter the
state of the game based on those decisions, including any knock-on
effects that each decision may or may not have on the rest of the game.
Rendering and player controls can use a standard game engine, but
content should be driven by your original narrative architecture.
