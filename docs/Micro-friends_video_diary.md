This is your chance to be the next Instagram! As more people carry
video-capture devices (Google Glass, Go Pro) we collect hours of video.
Some of those hours include sequences of friends enjoying themselves.
But nobody has time to review and edit all that footage. Your task is to
use a face detection algorithm (Viola Jones works well) to extract those
precious seconds where a friend's face is moving enough to be exciting.
If your friends are a little less expressive, you can crop or speed them
up as necessary. The goal is to turn the most engaging video extracts
into a collection of animated GIFs, each one or two seconds long, that
are embedded in a web page to provide a moving diary of your social
life.
