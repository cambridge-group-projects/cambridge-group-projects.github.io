Many people increasingly exist in an ideological bubble, getting all
their news from a handful of sources that they trust and shunning
everything else. This leads to polarised, insular viewpoints, stifling
debate and increasing divisiveness. Your task is to make a web browser
plugin which encourages users to read about a story from multiple
angles. When reading an article, it can suggest an alternative, opposing
source for the same topic. It needs to be able to categorise stories so
that it can recognise the same topic in different publications,
categorise sources so that it can find an interesting alternative stance
(ideally not just how left- or right-leaning it is, but also things like
the background of the author, the size and age of the publication, the
tone of the articles), and also present this to the user in a way which
will circumvent their defensive instincts and encourage an open mind.
