Waiting lists for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) assessments are growing, partly due to the
extensive time specialists spend on developmental history taking-often
hours per patient. This project aims to create a conversational AI tool
that allows children and their parents to provide comprehensive patient
history in a natural, dialogue-based manner. By engaging users in a
conversational interface rather than requiring them to fill out lengthy
forms, the system can extract necessary clinical information and
automatically format it into a report. This innovation seeks to
streamline the initial assessment process, saving specialists' time and
potentially reducing waiting lists.
