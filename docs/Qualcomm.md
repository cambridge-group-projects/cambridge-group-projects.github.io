'Tunmer, Luke' <ltunmer@qti.qualcomm.com> had proposed:

Because the Pi is such a cheap computer, it seems it should be ideal for
the increasingly discussed ideas of home-hubs, automated home and the
internet-of-things. The Pi can play a dual role - the hub itself, and
prototypes of small connected things. Software available for the Pi such
as XBMC to power media centres, and Asterisk to enable voice/phone
management seem to provide powerful hub capabilities, while the GPIO
port on the board will open it up to be the prototypes for connected
elements to all kinds of items in the home.

I project which showed some real innovation in what could be achieved in
the connected home could challenge a group of students with strengths in
different aspects of computer science and user design.
