Wildlife and critical ecosystems around the world include over 230,000
legal "protected areas", ranging in size from Coldham's Common in
Cambridge <https://protectedplanet.net/555561770> to the Serengeti
<https://protectedplanet.net/555570276>. Many people from tourists to
researchers and conservationists need to know about these, but there is
no quick way to find out whether you are near one. If one is nearby,
what can be found there? Barren scrubland or dense forest? Could a park
manager see evidence of agriculture where there shouldnâ€™t be, or a
visiting scientist learn that the area has been flooded? Your task is to
build a mobile application that enables the user to quickly orientate
themselves with nearby protected areas, and deliver contextual data by
accessing other services. You should specifically include data from the
European Space Agencies Global Land Cover Layer to show the percentage
of cover types within the protected area (e.g. 40% Mosaic vegetation,
60% Mosaic grassland), and you may include other information such as
geolocated photos from Flickr, or species from the IUCN red list of
threatened species.
