We live in a consumer society, often buying more things than we really
need. Everything we buy has some environmental impact. For example, it
takes 2700 litres of water to make one cotton T-shirt. If your garment
is made out of polyester, it will take it 20 â€“ 200 years to decompose.
We could all benefit by reducing our environmental impact by buying
fewer things or by buying things that are more environmentally friendly.
Your task is to develop a HoloLens application that evaluates the impact
of an item on the environment given a picture of the item.
