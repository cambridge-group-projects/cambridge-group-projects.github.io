Painting conservators at the Hamilton Kerr Institute often identify
pigment substances in paint by analysing microscope images. They need a
tool that enhances their expert judgment, using computer vision
algorithms from the OpenCV library to automate mundane classification
tasks. This interactive tool should provide a structured and flexible
decision process that optimises search for the most likely substance, by
allowing the conservator to quickly eliminate unlikely possibilities,
and to focus on those properties that seem most ambiguous or problematic
for any particular sample.
