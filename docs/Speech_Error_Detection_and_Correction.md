Children with cleft palate often experience specific speech errors that
require targeted feedback to correct. Traditional speech therapy
sessions are time-consuming and may not provide immediate, specific
guidance during at-home practice. This project aims to develop an
interactive tool that detects cleft-related speech errors and offers
real-time, personalised feedback. The tool must create a baseline and
then learn as the child practices how they are improving. The goal is to
support speech therapists by providing patients with an engaging way to
practice and improve their speech outside of clinical sessions,
enhancing the overall effectiveness of treatment.
