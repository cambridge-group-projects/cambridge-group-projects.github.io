Mobile phones have revolutionised the developing world making
information easily available to those even in the most remote parts of
the world. However, the smartphone has yet to make a big impact there.
This may be due to users having limited technical or even literacy
skills. You will create an app which people can use on their smartphones
to create audio websites, for example to advertise their agricultural
products. This will allow others in similar geographical locations to
make contact and perhaps even purchase directly from the seller using
audio as well.
