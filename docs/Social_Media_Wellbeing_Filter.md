Social media is part of our everyday lives, but constant exposure can
have negative effects - to the point where people remove themselves
entirely from social networks. We want to make social media more
positive for people, with a plugin that checks in with the user each day
and can make suggestions or adjust feeds based on their mental state.
How much negativity can they can deal with? Did they already have a bad
day? Do they feel ready to see some bad news, but not too much? You
might want to take on large platforms like Facebook or Twitter, or
perhaps start with plugins or readers for a more specialist platform
like Reddit.
