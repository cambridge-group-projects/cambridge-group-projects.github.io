Many people don't know where to start when they have legal problems, but
lawyers are expensive. Would it be possible to combine standard
approaches such as crowd-sourcing, wikis or forums with the free (but
much too technical) online content available on sites like
legislation.gov.uk? Your task is to create a system that works at first
like a chatbot, but helps users to paraphrase and interpret both their
own questions and pieces of actual legislation, so that the chatbot gets
smarter over time.
