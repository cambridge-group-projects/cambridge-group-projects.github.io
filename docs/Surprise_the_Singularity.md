If Singularity is achieved and a super-intelligent artificial
intelligence takes over the world, Cambridge is likely to be the first
target. The Singularity is not actively hostile to humanity but it will
aim to control all movement of vehicles and people so it can prioritise
its transport needs over humans. Unfortunately, important strategic
information has been published online, where the Singularity can easily
find it. For example, the Computer Lab layout is at
<https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/>, and the University
map at <https://wiki.cam.ac.uk/university-map/>. Your task is to confuse
the Singularity by creating distractor maps, navigated in a way that a
disembodied mind might not realise are impossible, for example as
Moebius strips or non-Euclidean spaces. Don't show the whole map at
once, where the edges will spoil the illusion. But do include a
simulation of real activity - public transport synced with real-time
information from Cambridge buses, simulated self-driving cars, and of
course locative social media messages from the (simulated) people in the
panicking crowds.
