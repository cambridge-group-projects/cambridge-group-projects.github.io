Too many cyclists are injured or killed by collisions with trucks and
buses, particularly at junctions. We have data that could help. All
Cambridge buses have real time GPS tracking, and cyclists increasingly
wear GPS-connected devices like the Pebble smartwatch. We propose a
single online simulation and warning system, accessed from screens and
that exploits both historic and real data, to help drivers and cyclists
avoid accidents. Using historical data the simulation can be used to
give drivers and cyclists an appreciation of the dangers and provide
general warnings of dangerous traffic conditions for the time of day.
The real time data can be fed back to cyclists out on the streets by the
warning system, with coded buzzes on their wrist helping them plan
routes and avoid any danger ahead.
