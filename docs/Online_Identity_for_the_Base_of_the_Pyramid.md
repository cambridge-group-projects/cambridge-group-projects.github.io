Initiatives such as Girl Effect and StoryBank provide new content
channels for the poorest people in developing countries to gain a
visible online identity. How could you minimise the educational and
financial obstacles to their visibility in the global media ecosystem?
SMS hubs such as Frontline SMS, or village kiosks containing Raspberry
Pi with cameras? Are keyboards or screens essential? You'll need to
consider user literacy and appropriate interaction mechanisms for those
whose technical expertise may be limited, but who will be empowered by
gaining new skills. Finally, don't forget that having a voice is not
sufficient to have an identity - somebody has to hear it.
