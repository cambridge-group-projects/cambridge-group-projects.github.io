When people move jobs they take the knowledge they’ve gained with them,
but their learner records often stay with their employer. This is not
only impractical, but ethically questionable. The advent of Web 3.0
technologies allows people to take ownership of their learner records
and control who they share their data with. Utilising SoulBound Tokens
(SBTs) your task is to build a model that captures a user’s learning
engagement data, certificates etc. via a non-transferable NFT smart
contract (known as a ‘Soul’), based on Ethereum. Your smart contract
code will likely be written in Remix IDE and Sol/Python language with
“mint” and constructor rules. Another challenge is to think about a data
structure standard and how data exchange and editing will be done. There
are two use cases: 1) when someone wants to share their Soul with their
current employer; 2) when someone wants to add or update data on their
Soul. The main priority is to make this process safe and secure for the
user.
