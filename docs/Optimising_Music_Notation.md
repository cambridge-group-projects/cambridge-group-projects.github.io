Client: Arild Stenberg, Score Designs Group <arildstenberg@gmail.com>

The LaTeX typesetting system can be used to render many alternative
styles of document from a master text specification. In contrast, music
typesetting systems like Sibelius make all music look much the same.
Your client has designed an optimised alternative style for music
notation that has been found to improve performance. Your task is to
define a specification language for these modifications, and implement a
rendering pipeline either as Sibelius extensions, or using an open
source music rendering back-end such as PMW (whose author, Philip Hazel,
will be available as a consultant to the project).
