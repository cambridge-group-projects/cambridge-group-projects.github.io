Online retailers invest heavily in reformatting information from product
catalogues into their own databases, and this is a barrier to entry for
new businesses. But it should be possible to automate the startup
process, by using artificial intelligence to extract the common data
structure for standard products that get sold by dozens of different
retailers. You must first create a machine learning algorithm that can
automatically infer page templates by comparing product detail pages for
the same product being sold on a variety of existing retail sites. Those
templates can then be applied to extract the semi-structured data from
retail sites for further products that have not been seen in the
training phase. The resulting database will then be automatically
published as a brand new shopping site, offering instant startup at the
press of a button, allowing specialist entrepreneurs to cater for niche
retail markets such as toothpaste-compare.com, muesli-and-sandal-world,
or toysforhamsters.
