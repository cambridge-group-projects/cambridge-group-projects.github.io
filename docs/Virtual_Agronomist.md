Each year NIAB publishes its Agronomy Strategy to help farmers grow
successful crops. The comprehensive advice is based on NIAB's internal
research and covers a range of topics including: crop choice and
rotation, seed rate and establishment, weed control and fungicide
strategies. NIAB would like to use this guide to produce a 'virtual
agronomist', an expert system which can be used by farmers to answer
their questions. The system should be able to accept a basic natural
language question, e.g. "What seed rate should I use for late sown
wheat?" and either show the relevant answer, or prompt for more
information with further questions, e.g. "What variety of wheat have you
sown?", and so on. The virtual agronomist should be accessed through
either a website or messenger platform (e.g. WhatsApp). Basic reporting
should be made available to administrators, such as frequent query
subjects, to identify where to direct new research.
