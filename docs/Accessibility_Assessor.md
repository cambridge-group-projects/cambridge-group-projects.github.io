Today, with smart phones being such powerful computational devices
equipped with cameras the opportunity to capture data from the world
around us has greatly increased. This project aims to produce a piece of
software which can be used on a smartphone to capture the 3d shape of an
interior environment in order to produce a simplified computer model.
This model may then be processed, perhaps by another device in order to
produce a node graphed plan of the floorspace. This plan could provide
useful views of the space in terms of accessibility and aiding planning
usage of existing space.
