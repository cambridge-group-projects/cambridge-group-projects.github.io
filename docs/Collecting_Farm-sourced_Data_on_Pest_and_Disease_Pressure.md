Farmers routinely provide data on crop disease and pests but not in
real-time, as they are discovered in the field, due to problems of
ease-of-use and concerns around how data will be used after being
reported. Accurate, timely reporting could significantly reduce crop
losses, use of crop protection chemicals, and produce better
understanding of how crop diseases and pests develop and spread,
geographically and temporally. Your challenge is to develop a mobile
reporting app with an intuitive and rapid user interface, based on an
understanding of the incentives and barriers farmers face in reporting
issues.
