In older entertainment software levels were often created very quickly
through the use of specialised tools to paint and author them using
basic primitives and formats, rather than the current fashion of using
detailed art modelling

Create an artistic package to allow the creation of less detailed
environments through geometrical ‘painting’ with preset assets. The
resulting environments should be exportable in at least one common
usable format to be used in another popular package. The package must
support the placement of instances of geometry, and the shaping and
arrangement of walls and floors to form recognisable and sensibly
navigable buildings and open spaces.

The resulting packages aim will be to use some older creative approaches
in the modern 3d medium to allow enthusiasts to quickly build creative
environments, with the option of exporting them for ‘detailing’ in other
more involved packages later.
