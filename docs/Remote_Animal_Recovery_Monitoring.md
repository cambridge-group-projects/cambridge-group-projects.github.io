Like humans, dogs often suffer from injuries and joint problems but,
unlike humans, there is no data resource to monitor postoperative
recovery in small animals. Your task is to create a mobile phone app
enabling dog carers to monitor progress of their dogs during revovery
after orthopaedic surgery, provide information on what to expect, and
connect them with their consultant. You will work with a leading
veterinary orthopaedic surgeon specialising in treatment of these
conditions, with the potential to significantly improve the quality of
life for many animals with this new form of remote patient support.
