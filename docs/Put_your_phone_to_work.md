When people browse social media sites on their phones for hours every
day, most of the CPU power goes unused. The old desktop equivalent of
this problem was the screensaver, which did little of value until it was
co-opted for distributed computing projects such as SETI@home. Your task
is to make a platform that can perform useful computation in the
background on a large number of mobile phones, while the owners are on
social media - or even while they are asleep. It will have to run
cross-platform, perhaps using JavaScript, but must also give the
appropriate incentives to users - will it drain batteries or incur
network charges? If so, what kind of application would customers pay to
run on such a platform? Would phone sensors offer any specific value?
You need to demonstrate an end-to-end solution including servers, mobile
clients and an example application, keeping in mind the security
implications if either customers or phone owners try to cheat the
system.
