Recent research has used machine learning methods to apply the language
philosophy of Wittgenstein, in a way that can quantify the likelihood of
any particular text being bulls\*\*t. These results have extraordinarily
exciting implications for political discussion, journalism, corporate
press releases, even the content of Facebook or eX-Twitter. Your task is
to create a BS-meter that uses these methods to produce an intuitive
test device accessible to anyone, perhaps with an international
authentication body that can apply validated BS stamps to any text that
deserves it.
