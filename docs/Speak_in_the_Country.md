People who live in rural areas of low-income countries find it difficult
to access online services. They may have low literacy, and often rely on
feature phones rather than smartphones for their communication needs.
The goal of this project is to help people in that situation access
medical advice via the latest speech technology from Cambridge company
Speechmatics, in a system that will take voice messages in a local
language, transcribe and match their needs to relevant information
resources, and return recorded advice or monitor disease outbreaks.
Health workers at local clinics should have a dashboard to monitor
issues in their region, and also to flag conversations where a human
expert needs to intervene.
