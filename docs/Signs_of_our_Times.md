Client: Katherine Powlesland, Digital Levi Project <klp47@cam.ac.uk>

In times of political turmoil, media commentary is transient, with more
profound understanding coming only decades later. In future years, we
will find that someone really knew what was happening today, in the same
way Primo Levi, for example, captured the true tragedies of the Second
World War in his masterpiece If This is a Man. Levi invites us to
vividly participate in his text so that the same thing is never allowed
to happen again. What future tragedies might be avoided if we could
bring scholarly analysis of important works like these into dialogue
with current concerns and debates, especially as expressed online? Your
goal is to build a prototype for an innovative digital edition of If
This is a Man, that inspires thoughtful reflection through immersion and
elegance far beyond the trivial claims made for the Metaverse.
