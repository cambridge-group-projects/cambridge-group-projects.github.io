Visitors to the [Fitzwilliam Museum](Fitzwilliam_Museum "wikilink") in
Cambridge can currently use a handheld eGuide, deployed on PDAs with
location sensing infrastructure from local company Hypertag. Your task
is to design a next-generation guide aimed at an audience of eight-year
olds. The device should enable users to guide the rest of their family
around the Museum during their visit. It should also allow users to
construct a thematic story inspired by a selection of museum objects. By
combining the user's narrative with multimedia material, the system will
automatically generate a personalised (HTML-based) videogame that users
and their friends can later play online.
