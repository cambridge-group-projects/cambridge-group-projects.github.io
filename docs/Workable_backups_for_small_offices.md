Considering replacing this with [Auto-Archive](Auto-Archive "wikilink")

Your client’s office has half a dozen staff using networked PCs, who
generate moderately large quantities of data - about 1Gb per month for
each person, with permanent storage of maybe 8Tb each. They would like
an off-site backup system. They are prepared to use USB hard discs to
physically carry data off site, but really important data should be
uplinked to somewhere in the cloud. You have to locate what has changed
(these machines are in constant use, so you can’t take the hard disk
offline to scan it), and decide if it is important or duplicates
existing material. Remember that it takes time to transfer data on their
1Gbit network, and even more to the net, with a connection of about
200Mbit down / 20Mbit up. You need to make the backups incremental, but
with a naming / navigation scheme so that they can be retrieved by
reference to the originals. You should also consider security.
