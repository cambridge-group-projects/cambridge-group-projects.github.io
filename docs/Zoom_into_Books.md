Art and travel books often have beautiful images, but it’s frustrating
that you can’t pinch to zoom as you would with a phone, to see
arbitrarily high resolution details. The purpose of this project is to
identify those times when a picture in a book or magazine corresponds to
an existing high resolution image that is available online. Your Android
app should work in augmented reality style, starting with a view of the
book through the phone camera, but then seamlessly zooming by
substituting high-resolution online data.
