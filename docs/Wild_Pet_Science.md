Children are often strong supporters of wildlife conservation, but also
have pets of their own. The goal of this project is to help them engage
with the science of wildlife tracking (via public data sources such as
movebank.org), comparing that data to monitoring information that they
collect themselves. Although Movebank uses GPS, sonar and other
expensive techniques, you could use simple image analysis from a
Raspberry Pi time-lapse camera to identify the position of a goldfish, a
guinea pig or a hamster in its cage (you can use toy animals for the
public demo). Children should be able to use the data they collect to
make comparisons between their own pets and wild animals - this might
include foraging behaviour, "migrations" or seasonal variation in
activity.
