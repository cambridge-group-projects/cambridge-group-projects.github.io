Chatbot dialog builders can be used to create systems that are very good
at dispensing accurate information such as medical advice, following a
configurable decision tree, but the output text needs to be standardised
and impersonal. Language model-based text generators on the other hand,
produce text that is grammatical and possibly entertaining but often
factually wrong. Your task is to integrate the two into a demonstrator
for the World Health Organisation that can be configured by public
health clinicians to give accurate advice when needed on problems like
Covid infection, and can also stimulate mental health with original
creative responses - but only when the question from the patient makes
it safe to do so!
