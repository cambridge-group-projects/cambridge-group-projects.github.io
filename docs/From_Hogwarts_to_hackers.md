Many children are more interested in imaginative stories than tinkering
with circuit boards. But they need not be excluded from Raspberry Pi.
The goal of this project is to create a multiplayer online game, where
each room of a castle runs on a different Raspberry Pi. The owner of
that Pi should be able to define surroundings, objects, characters and
scripted interactions (e.g. to learn spells or solve challenges) as well
as visiting other player's rooms. Players get to learn about network
topologies, scripting languages and command lines - but all while having
sociable fun. A text adventure game might be the best choice - for
example, of the kind that can be created with plot scripting language
Inform7, or LambdaMOO, but you are free to attempt simple graphics or
other presentation styles.
