In principle, computer vision and machine learning methods can be used
to recognise coeliac disease. “Coeliac disease” is a very common
autoimmune condition triggered by eating gluten, and treatable by
following a gluten-free diet. Currently, in order to diagnose coeliac
disease, pathologists manually inspect biopsies of gut tissue. We would
like to automate this diagnosis process. Unfortunately, there are some
difficulties; for example, different microscopes make the colours of the
images look different, different samples look very different from each
other, the images are huge, and we are interested in both small-scale
and large-scale features. This project involves working on part of this
process to allow for much faster and more accurate diagnosis, making use
of computer vision and machine learning methods with other tools (for
example image editors).
