Major sporting events such as marathons and triathlons often raise funds
and awareness for good causes including conservation. This project is an
opportunity to design a new global sport where human challenges are
measured against the challenges faced by wildlife such as migrating wild
birds. You will use the Strava API to capture records of human
performance, and monitoring data from bird migration (available from
your client) to represent wildlife. You will need to define the rules
for this new hybrid sport, including secure and fair algorithms to
determine the competition results that might combine running, cycling
and flying stages. Will humans compete against birds, or be combined in
hybrid teams? Your technical platform should also include social media
and live stream support to that can be scaled to global public
participation such as refereeing, commentary, fan clubs or cash
sponsorship.
