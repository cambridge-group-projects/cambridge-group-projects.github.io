The skill of a business entrepreneur is turning a few key terms, and
some names of people and places, together with some financial figures,
into a compelling narrative. Until now, it has been time consuming to
manually extract relevant names and figures from reports filed at
Companies House. It requires hard thought and creativity to write about
the business opportunity. Your project has two parts. The first is
automatic extraction of pertinent information from company filings,
using methods such as syntactic parsers or named entity recognition. The
second part is to use a combination of visual design and generative
language models to create web pages that pitch the business to new
investors, or perhaps provide the template for a competing start-up.
