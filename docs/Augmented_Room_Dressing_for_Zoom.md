Client: Matt Johnson, [Frontier](Frontier "wikilink")
<mjohnson@frontier.co.uk>, working with Olly Powell
<opowell@frontier.co.uk>

In these times of Covid-19, many of us are spending much more time alone
and interacting with colleagues and peers via webcams in virtual
meetings. In the spirit of light relief, we would like the client to
produce a fun application which would capture the video feed from a
webcam, augment it with entertaining elements such as models, images or
animations (For example, one option may be to provide a virtual set of
bookshelves in the background to allow the user to appear better read
for an interview!). The application should be able to work with some
captured 3d information about the scene in order to place the friendly
or amusing augmentations to brighten up the room of the user, or even
provide some interactive background elements. The output should then be
supplied as a virtual camera feed which may be consumed by applications
such as Zoom or Teams.
