It's always disappointing when you've had a great night out, but you
can't remember the details the next day. It would be creepy to
photograph everyone, but simple to take a short video with a quick scan
of the room. Your goal is to build a social media platform with video
upload as the main user interface. Your back-end processing will apply
open source machine vision libraries such as OpenCV, OpenFace and others
to capture faces, match them against known friends, see who is talking
to who (from head orientation) and so on. You should package the results
as a fun and engaging social media site. Consider making a plugin using
the WeChat Video API - or perhaps this could be the next Facebook!
