Today's most powerful machine learning models, including generative AI
LLMs like ChatGPT, encode their knowledge as higher dimensional latent
spaces. Vector-based concepts in that space can be clustered as regions
on a 2D screen, for example using the t-SNE visualisation algorithm.
Your task is to create a 3D version of t-SNE that is interactive, so
users with VR headsets can literally “grasp” a concept, and manipulate
it to explore, fine-tune, or adjust the machine learning model.
