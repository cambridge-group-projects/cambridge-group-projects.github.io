The Cambridge University Map supports a sophisticated annotation API,
based on GeoJSON. Your task is to create an interactive application that
allows users to relate the research and technology of locations in
contemporary Cambridge to the things that happened in those places in
earlier historical times. The Talks.cam system has an API that can be
used to gather information about what is being discussed in a particular
location right now. You'll need to find some alternative sources of
information for the events of 100 or 1000 years ago. To engage users,
your goal is to give a seamless interaction - overlaying with swipe, pan
and zoom to peel down the past, or scrape off the present, in a kind of
virtual archaeology.
