The campylobacter bacterium is commonly found in the UK food chain,
causing 22,000 hospitalisations and 110 deaths each year. It is
important for schools to teach basic principles for avoiding infection
in farms and shops or cross-contamination between uncooked chicken and
other food or utensils. Your task is to design a distributed whole-class
education app, in which everyone in the class must learn together what
steps to take, acting at the same time. You could base this on the
popular Crossy Road game, but adopting a farm and kitchen setting. The
whole class should learn to cooperate in guiding a new-born chicken as
it travels from farm to fork, making decisions based on what they have
learned.
