Client: Sandi Toksvig, Mappa Mundi project

Google Earth, Google Maps and Google Streetview have turned surveillance
data into commercial opportunities ranging from Deliveroo to Down My
Street. But coverage tends to focus on sponsored business opportunities,
rather than the livelihoods and communities of real women and men. Your
task is to prototype an infrastructure of an interactive globe, where
viewers can fluidly zoom in to connect to people's "best self", using
their own verified images to represent their streets, homes and
families. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to share ideas with a leading game
developer, on how to make the world fairer and more peaceful.
