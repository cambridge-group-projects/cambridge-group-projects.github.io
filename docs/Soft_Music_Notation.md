Anyone who plays an instrument is familiar with receiving sheet music in
a PDF file, but the technical facilities for enhancing that experience
are terrible. This project will involve extracting the actual musical
semantics (notes and their lengths) from PDF files, encoding these as
MusicXML, and allowing the music to be adjusted, personalised, and
optimised for performance using the advanced typographic tools created
by a prize-winning group project team last year.
