Everyone is familiar with visual acuity tests, where you read an eye
chart on the wall, while a nurse or optometrist asks which letters you
can see. These are expensive and time-consuming to run, but there may be
alternatives. Imagine a display screen on the wall of a chemist, a
doctor's waiting room, or a driving test centre, running the eye test as
a full-screen page in a standard browser. You take out your phone,
connect to a shared web server using an on-screen QR code, then stand in
the spot marked on the floor at a calibrated 4m distance. All remaining
instructions are delivered over audio from your phone headset, with any
necessary interaction eyes-free (e.g. 'touch the left of your phone if
you can see a "b", touch the right if you see a "d"'). You should ensure
that the result is private and secure, including a mechanism to send you
the results by email without bystanders seeing who you are (remember
that the people being tested may be elderly, with poor eyesight).
