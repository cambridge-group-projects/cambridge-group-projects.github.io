The what3words service has become very successful, with its pitch that
three random words can identify any location on the planet. If youâ€™ve
used it, you may have noticed that the random words are often strangely
relevant to the Cambridge locations being specified - if not for one
particular cell, then quite likely for the cell next to it. Your task is
to use a combination of natural language processing and path
optimisation methods to turn these into engaging stories, starting from
the creative seed of places you have visited, or perhaps would like to
visit.
