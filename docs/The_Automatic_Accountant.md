The Automatic Statistician is a system created by Zoubin Ghahramani and
colleagues that looks for interesting patterns in data sets (by fitting
Gaussian process models), and then automatically generates a research
paper, including charts and natural language texts, describing the
patterns that it finds. Financial accounting data is relatively
constrained in its format, so it should be more straightforward to
create an AI system that automatically generates professional-looking
reports on a companyâ€™s performance, including capabilities for audit and
compliance checking that work by recognising statistical anomalies. You
will need to familiarise yourself with the research from
www.automaticstatistician.com, and work with your client to design an
original accounting application.
