Client [Entrepreneur First](Entrepreneur_First "wikilink")

Contact: Matt Clifford <matt@entrepreneurfirst.org.uk>

Many tech companies collect data about potential employees via online
application forms. But it's hard to know whether your own answers to
each question are going to look competitive. Wouldn't it be great if you
got feedback as you were typing, like the password strength guidance
often provided when you choose a new password? The goal of this project
is to use the large database of applications to Entrepreneur First to
train a live interactive form processor that gives feedback as you type
on how employable you seem to be. Once the form is complete, it should
return a visualised "employability map" that pinpoints how you stand in
relation to all the other potential applicants - for example, using data
gained from a business networking site like LinkedIn. This map should
take account of various aspects of employability (qualifications,
technical experience, social life) and also the trade-offs between them.
