Many games allow online players to chat in one form or another. More
adult games allow free chat in lobbies, or within the game. Some
products with younger appeal allow regimented exchanges of ‘phrases’,
such as ‘I’m the fastest’, ‘This time let’s play Rainbow Road’ to avoid
inappropriate discussion.

Both of these formats have drawbacks, either being too limited to make
meaningful conversation, or too open for inappropriate behaviour and
abuse.

Create a tool and module to provide a multiperson chat experience based
on a configurable grammar where the users can converse through the
stringing together of grammatical tokens to make meaningful, but limited
conversational exchanges.

The module should provide both a lobby and an ingame mode of
conversation, and provide configurable options for the tokens visual and
aural representation.
