Much of agricultural work is difficult and dangerous, leading to a
labour shortage across the sector and an increase in robotics and
automation on farms. Growers today commonly employ cutting-edge
technologies including temperature and moisture sensors, robots, and GPS
technology to perform the tasks that humans donâ€™t want to do. Your task
is to design an app-based system that reports sensor data and health and
safety information from our asparagus picking robot, over both The
Things and Helium IoT networks.
