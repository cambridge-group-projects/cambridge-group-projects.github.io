The very first AI chatbot was the psychotherapist Eliza. For young
people today, mental health is more challenging than ever, but we arenâ€™t
using LLM technology in ways that reduce stress. Your goal is to create
a de-stressing experience, potentially including responsive sound and
imagery alongside short generated text exchanges that respond to what is
stressing you. A fully automated chain should direct stressful content
(e.g. an email from your DoS) directly into the system so that you can
be properly de-stressed before you even read it.
