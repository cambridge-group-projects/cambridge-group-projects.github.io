Machine Learning researchers often try multiple configurations of
machine learning algorithms using libraries such as GPyOpt. The
convergence resulting from different configurations is unknown in
advance, but could be visualised in real time, while multiple
alternatives run concurrently in the cloud. Your task is to create a
control panel with architecture support that will allow researchers to
monitor large numbers of simultaneous Python experiments, interactively
shutting some down, or tweaking parameters via the user interface, in
response to what they see.
