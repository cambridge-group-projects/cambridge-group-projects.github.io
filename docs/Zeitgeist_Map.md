You land in a new country and suddenly you hear new songs on the radio,
new songs being played in the club, and you hear people referencing
artists you’ve never heard of. People also dress differently and follow
trends you never knew existed. Because of the internet and social media,
you would expect most of the current trends to be present everywhere,
but every country is still different in its own way. The goal of this
project is to create a web-based world map with which one can easily
visualize how popular different music trends are in certain countries.
The user can select either a genre or an artist, and the map lights up
with a gradient where they are mostly listened to. Or, conversely, a
user selects a specific country (let’s say their next study exchange
destination) and can see all the current music trends: top songs,
artists, genres. It would be great if the user could also play short
snippets of the displayed songs and genres, and even visualize their
popularity over time - to see how trends come and go. The basic idea can
then also be expanded to include movies, series, and books, if there's
time.
