Procedural landscape generators are often used in videogames, for
example to create new unexplored planets. What would a procedural
creature generator look like? Recent experiments demonstrate that a
neural network can learn how to control robot arms, if it has enough to
explore with. Your task is to create a 3D editor that allows users to
define a new kind of alien creature - legs, claws, sensors whatever -
which then learns how to behave through experimentation with the laws of
physics applying to its own body in a simple environment (furniture food
etc).
