The COP26 conference has highlighted the need for decisive action on
climate change, both for governments and companies around the world. But
which of these are just talking, and which are setting concrete goals?
Goals can be evaluated using the SMART framework
(https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals).
The SMART acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant
and Time-Bound. Create a system which can be used to analyse reports and
statements, and identify climate change-related "goals" within them, and
then evaluate these goals against the SMART criteria.
