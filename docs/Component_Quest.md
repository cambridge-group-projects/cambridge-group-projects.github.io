The electronics industry faces chip shortages, rising costs, and
increasing e-waste. This creates demand for secondhand components, but
it can be difficult to identify and value them. Develop a smartphone app
that uses AI to identify and value electronic components (usually still
mounted on PCBs) using the phone camera. The app should handle a wide
range of components, provide current market value, and link users to a
marketplace to buy and sell them.
