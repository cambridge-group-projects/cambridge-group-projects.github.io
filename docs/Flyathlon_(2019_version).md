Major sporting events such as marathons and triathlons often raise funds
and awareness for good causes including conservation. This is an
opportunity to design a new global sport where humans compete digitally
in relay teams alongside wildlife. Using the Strava API, and records of
bird migration from the British Trust for Ornithology, create secure and
fair infrastructure for a competition that includes joint teams of
cyclists and wild birds, attracting large audiences through public
engagement for refereeing, commentary, fan clubs and sponsorship.
