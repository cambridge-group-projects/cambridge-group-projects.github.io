The Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy has appointed 10 leading poets to work
with Cambridge University Museums and young people from the county. Your
task is to provide a novel tool that can emulate the exact layout of any
page from a museum web server, but with the original text (perhaps
partly) removed. Invited poets and young people should be able to
substitute their own poetry or other text by typing directly over the
visual layout as if in a drawing editor. These transformed pages can
then be published and viewed from an alternative server that offers a
"mashed up" version of any museum page for public viewing. The technical
challenge is to give users the impression that they are really typing
directly onto the rendered web page, as if onto a piece of paper, and to
do so in a way that emhasises typographic freedom, allowing poets direct
control over all concrete aspects of the juxtaposed text.
