During the COP26 conference, it became clear that many politicians
around the world do not necessarily follow the party lines of the 20th
century left versus right, but are dividing themselves between those who
mainly plan for the future, and those that focus on protecting the past.
It should be possible to use natural language processing to help the
electorate decide between these alternatives, by identifying the real
allegiance of public officials to classify them as either fossil or
future. Simple bag-of-words classifiers won’t be enough, because anybody
could mislead readers by dropping in random words. It’s likely that
you’ll need to use some kind of deep learning, and also plan for the
possibility of inadvertent bias or even malicious sabotage when
collecting the training set.
