Modern teenagers have to spend hours every day pressing like buttons on
Facebook and Instagram. Your task is to automate this drudge-work. Of
course, these companies really want to trap eyeballs, so they won't make
it easy for you. You will probably have to emulate a web browser, which
at least pretends to be looking at the posts before automatically
"clicking" on the like-link. It will also be embarrassing if it likes
the wrong thing, so some machine learning will be involved to monitor,
learn and then anticipate the user's real preferences (kittens = like,
parents = dislike etc).
