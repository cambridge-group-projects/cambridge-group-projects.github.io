You are tasked with the development of an autonomous drone delivery
system for light-weight package transportation around the West Cambridge
site. By using high-fidelity drone models from the new MathWorks UAV
Toolbox, you will develop an autonomous ground control system that
coordinates one (or more!) drones around the site. Consider how to
incorporate path and task planning, motor and plant control, and sensing
& perception for navigation and obstacle avoidance. Evaluation in the
realistic UE4 simulation will include simulated sensor data from 3D
LIDAR readings and simulated camera input.
