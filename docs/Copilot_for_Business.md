We’re all familiar with the code generation capabilities of ChatGPT and
GitHub Copilot. That’s fine for experienced programmers, but how could
an AI coding tool support people who have never written a line of code?
Your goal is to create a user friendly natural language interface that
not only generates code for extracting and visualising data from an
arbitrary business database, but helps non-programmer users to
understand how that code works, recognising and correcting bugs or
hallucinations in the generated code.
