Many people are vaguely aware that their home PC may be part of a
botnet, but have no idea what this means in practice. The goal of this
project is to create an educational botnet based on the Raspberry Pi to
help people learn about computer security. Using Raspberry Pi means that
there is minimal financial risk if things go wrong, and the owner of a
node can reliably close it down simply by removing the SD card. Your job
is to create a Raspberry Pi boot image that can be installed and used by
a person having minimal technical knowledge - allowing them to "take
over" in a controlled manner the Raspberry Pis of other volunteers
(wherever they are), and simulate some of the behaviours of a botnet. A
little bit of spooky paranoia wouldn't hurt - perhaps making mysterious
sounds or unpredictably flashing lights after their node gets taken
over. The distribution, location and status of the net should be
visualised in a way that can be accessed from any web browser, but nodes
should be able to find each other without any user intervention or
central control. Of course, all this has to be achieved in a secure
sand-boxed manner - real hackers shouldn't be allowed to get out of the
sandbox!
