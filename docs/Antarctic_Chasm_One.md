The Brunt Ice Shelf in the Antarctic is growing a massive chasm at the
rate of 1.7km a year, that may lead to an area of nearly 1,000 sq km
breaking off and taking the Halley VI base with it. Your task is to make
a 3D immersive visualisation of this growing chasm, allowing viewers to
descend into it in the way that BBCâ€™s Peter Gibbs did on camera
(goo.gl/48cVds). You will have access to aerial scans, photographs,
video, multispectral satellite imagery, ground penetrating radar of the
crack and other data from technical specialists at British Antarctic
Survey (BAS). You will use these to extrapolate places where data is
missing, and also to model the growth of the chasm for a speeded-up view
of the future. For a full immersive effect, spatialized audio would add
further realism.
