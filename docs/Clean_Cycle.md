The CamBike Sensor project has been creating augmented sensing
capabilities for future bicycles, including GPS, LoRaWAN data
communications and air quality sensors. Your task is to create
infrastructure that captures and buffers data, transfers it when links
become available, and uses that data to profile air quality over time
and distance. The user view of this should be a route-planning
application that optimises daily and seasonal alternative routes,
guiding riders in dirty cities to minimise their pollution exposure
either for daily commutes or more intensive courier or delivery work.
