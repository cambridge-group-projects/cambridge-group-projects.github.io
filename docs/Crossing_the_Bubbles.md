We are all learning a lot about the dynamics of virus transmission, but
often in ways that leaves us having to trust experts who don’t
themselves understand why some social settings result in
“super-spreading,” others are benign “bubbles”, and how these very
different situations interact when people in a city move between them.
Your task is to create an intuitive environment that models and
visualises the dynamics of infection and transmission both within and
between diverse settings such as schools, private homes, and workplaces.
The key challenge is presenting controls that allow people without
mathematical training to experiment with causal parameters and
understand the often non-linear consequences over time. The
visualisations should be delivered via a web browser, intuitively
readable by primary school children, but based on real evidence and
mathematical models of transmission and infection dynamics.
