This challenge is to create a tool that generates chess puzzles (e.g.,
checkmates in 2 or 3 moves) by analysing real game positions from
publicly available datasets or coming up with "fake" positions -
although legal positions in chess! Existing chess engines like Leela and
Stockfish provide an evaluation score on any move, helping to identify
when someone has missed a check mate, or didn't see the best move from a
position. These outputs can then be used as a puzzle. Your objective is
to use AI methods to generate puzzles, based on patterns learned from
real games. The puzzles should be classified as belonging to recognised
categories (e.g. pins/skewer puzzles, queen + knight combination
puzzles, rook endgame puzzles, etc). You should also assign ratings or
difficulty level to each puzzle.
