This project will use the Microsoft Azure Sphere IoT platform to fulfill
a citizen science goal. The team is free to select the goal so long as
it uses at least one environmental sensor (temperature, pressure, etc)
and an output (e.g. LED), and at least 5 devices are deployed for a week
or more, with the Azure IoT Central service used to collate data for
visualisation. The design of the system should be documented openly
(e.g. on github) to enable reuse. Hardware (Azure Sphere development
kits and sensors) will be provided.
