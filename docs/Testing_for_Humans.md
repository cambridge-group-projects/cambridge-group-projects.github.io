Many companies rely on online programming aptitude tests to select
potential employees. Unfortunately, applicants can often fool the test
by finding answers online, or even generating a response automatically
using an AI chatbot. Your task is to create an authoring and
administration tool for aptitude question banks that automatically
benchmarks them against such strategies, helping the question author to
fine-tune them in a way that will guarantee human responses.
