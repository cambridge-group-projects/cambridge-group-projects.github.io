Lives and businesses have been transformed by the pandemic, with network
technology now more critical than ever. What are the implications for
smart buildings and the Internet of Things? Which classic IoT use cases
are now irrelevant, and what new opportunities are there? Your task is
to use the Microsoft Azure Sphere IoT platform to address one of the new
problems of the COVID-19 era. Your client can provide a range of
accessories (e.g cameras, sensors and actuators), and your solutions
should be documented openly (e.g. on GitHub) to enable broader benefits.
