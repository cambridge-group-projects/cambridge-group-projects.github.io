Many more people get their news from social media than TV, but much
national and international public health policy relies on public
broadcasting as the primary channel of communication. Your job is to
make a tool that helps reconnect local health emergencies and
interventions to local influencers who may be motivated to help. This
will involve using APIs from TikTok, Instagram etc, but mapping these
against local health statistics in a way that doctors and government
officials can see what is going on.
