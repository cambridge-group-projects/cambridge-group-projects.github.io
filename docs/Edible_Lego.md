It’s great fun to make elaborate decorations out of chocolate, but hard
to make anything really impressive, because big complex moulds are
impractical to commission. Your task is to make a 3D chocolate sculpture
tool that takes a (somewhat) arbitrary 3D shape, and decomposes it into
pieces that can be assembled from standard shaped blocks such as
chocolate bars. However, any unusual local details will need to be
queued offline to order a 3D-printed mould for that specific part. You
will have access to a basic 3D printer for testing purposes.
Unfortunately the Lab cannot supply chocolate, but this project could be
a good starting point for a revenue-making business model.
