Talk radio is incredibly popular, but doesnâ€™t (yet) have the same
capability for discussion and annotation that text formats do. Your task
is to create a software service that enhances the experience of
listening to talk radio. Your application will listen to the audio,
extract key words, and offer services such as background information on
an item, programme or presenter, linked visual media, comparison to
other news sources and authorities, or even AI-enabled interactive
fact-checking about the claims being made.
