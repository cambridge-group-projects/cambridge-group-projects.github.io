I am working with a social enterprise spinout called Kalamna CIC, who
offer secular Arabic teaching for children and parents in UK-based
families with Arabic as a spoken home language. Their classes aim to
introduce vernacular rather than “high” forms of written Arabic. They
use a phonics-based Arabic learning method which was developed by the
founder, Dr Saussan Khalil (Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern
studies). Saussan imagines that it would be possible to create an app
gamifying and making interactive some of the phonics-based content which
the younger students already use on paper and through existing very
basic digital flashcards and pdf books.
