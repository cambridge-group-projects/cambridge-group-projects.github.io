Grandparents and children both enjoy a quick chat, but often live too
far apart for regular opportunities. Older people also have challenges
with remote technology such as IoT, security devices, or media systems.
You can solve both problems in one, with a new universal remote that
establishes a voice channel to an available grandchild who can help
complete a control function through network redirection, automation or
scripting of commands while also providing regularly scheduled social
contact. Your remote app should be highly usable by people with visual,
motion control and memory impairments, while also being compatible with
a wide range of IoT and media devices.
