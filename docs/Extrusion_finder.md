Many offices, houses, furnishings and machines are made from lengths of
metal or plastic that have a constant cross-section, but come in
different lengths of extrusion. When one of these breaks, it ought to be
possible to fix it by ordering a replacement length and simply snapping
it into place. However, it's not necessarily easy to find the extrusion
you want. The result of this project would be a great new market
opportunity. A user can simply take a picture of the required
cross-section (using their phone, or perhaps a flatbed scanner), and the
system should automatically find the closest match from online
catalogues or sales sites such as seagateplastics.com. As a last resort,
an obsolete product could even be resurrected with 3D printing - but
there is far more profit to be made by making online referrals and have
someone else worry about the manufacturing!
