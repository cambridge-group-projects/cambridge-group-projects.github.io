Nobody takes the time to read the End User License Agreements (EULAs)
that we all agree to whenever we create an account, install an app, or
upgrade an operating system. Different people have different priorities,
and although some clauses buried in the EULA might relate to your own
concerns about privacy, cost, warranty or whatever, it would take hours
to read through and find them. This project will allow users to
personalise their own priorities in advance, then use NLP to instantly
visualise and navigate the parts of any new EULA that they most want to
check - perhaps raising red flags to highlight all the most worrying
phrases in a single screen view.
