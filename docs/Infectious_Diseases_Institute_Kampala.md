Suggestion:

[Distributed Microcontracts](Distributed_Microcontracts "wikilink")

Personal and small business finance innovations increasingly come from
low-income countries, as with the hugely successful M-Pesa mobile
payment system. The goal of this project is to create a distributed
payment and ledger system for organisations that commission many small
pieces of work in remote locations. It should use the sensor
capabilities of smartphones (e.g. camera, accelerometer, GPS) to
authenticate contracts, payment and verification of commissioned work in
an intuitive, secure and traceable way.

Might potentially work with local company [Obex
Technologies](Obex_Technologies "wikilink")
