Online shopping is taking over the world! A current growth area is the
use of robots and AI in efficiently running warehouses and retail
storage facilities. Your task is to produce a virtual warehouse
simulation and demonstrate how AI may be applied on this training suite
to control bots in their storage and retrieval of randomised streams of
orders for items to allow the suite to find efficient methods of
organising and driving a robotic warehouse area. How AI is applied to
the system, whether in terms of organisational control, or manipulation,
or both is up to the teams to decide.
