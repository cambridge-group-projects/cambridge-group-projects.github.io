Title: NLProject Manager Description: Software Engineering has pioneered
agility across multiple functions, however, the overhead of managing
projects remains excessively high. In agile project management, people
can be seen as a unique combination of skills, rather than the single
dimension offered by their job title. By using these skills as the
foundation, develop a platform that uses Natural Language Processing and
other methods to make software project management more efficient and
accurate. Your product should rely on code analysis for skill inference,
which can then be used to manage the project. Some examples might
include using skills to assign team members to certain issues, code
reviewers to merge requests, or helpers when someone gets stuck with
their work.
