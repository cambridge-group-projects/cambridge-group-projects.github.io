Introduction to come from Ross Anderson

Here's an idea. I was at the Europarl yesterday and a green MEP said it
would be great to have a "tranparency app" that would enable her and her
colleagues to look up the registered interests of people who come to
meetings. This would involve (a) writing apps for android and iphone (b)
having a service that would go to the various registers of interests in
Brussels, London etc, aggregate entries and make them available (c) some
smarts to make it usable. For example it would help that if Mr Johann
Schmidt were registered as getting funding from Infineon AG, that the
app would say that Infineon makes smartcards for use in banking and as
identity cards.
