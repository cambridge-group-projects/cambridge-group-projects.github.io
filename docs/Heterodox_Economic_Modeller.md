There is a long history of financial simulators that can be used to
model national economies, dating back to the water-powered “Phillips
machine” (we have one in Cambridge). Today’s economy is stuck in a rut,
because alternative economic theories are proposed by people whose
mathematical models are simply less well embedded than the legacy
implementations. Your task is to create a quick and dirty financial
simulator that could be used by heterodox economists to propose and
debate serious alternatives to outdated government and corporate
policies.
