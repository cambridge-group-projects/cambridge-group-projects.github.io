Social networks are a major part of our lives. The acquisition of
Twitter by Musk demonstrates how much influence one person can express
by changing the platform to his liking where users have no say in the
direction of the platform. Your assignment is to create a peer 2 peer
honest social network: a social network that has no central server that
anyone can join freely. You'll need to find or define a protocol that
allows users to communicate. Will you go truly peer2peer? Or would you
prefer a node-based approach where any server can join the network and
serve requests for users? It's important to ensure that users cannot
imitate each other. How do you prevent a hostile actor from joining the
networking and pretending to be someone else? There's no central
authentication server to verify this. Your solution should include a GUI
that allows for browsing user accounts. How would this work? How do you
fetch information about a user if there's no central server to provide
that, and should there be any restrictions?
