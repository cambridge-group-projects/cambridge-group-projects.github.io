Client: Nkatha Gichuyia, Urban Re-engineering Taskforce

Large cities around the world are grappling with plans to accommodate
environmental, social and climate change. But there is a huge gulf
between the technical software of geographical information systems and
infrastructure planning on one hand, and the retail and entertainment
data that is promoted in consumer products like Google Maps. The city of
Nairobi is thinking ahead through visionary planned cities as Nairobi
Railway City, Tatu City, and the Konza Technopolis, that aim to present
models of how an environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient urban
area developments in a carbon-constrained environment can be delivered.
Your role is to prototype a new social mapping tool that could engage
members of the local population in these discussions, visualising data,
plans, priorities, and their personal implications.
