It is easy to make a mistake when sending an email and the consequences
range from personal embarrassment to professional misconduct. In order
to prevent these errors, it is likely to be helpful to understand the
relations between different people associated with an email. At its
simplest, this could involve identifying and classifying the sender,
each recipient and any other people mentioned in the body of an email.
It might also be useful to provide a confidence score for each relation,
to recognise where a recipient is a member of a group of people such as
an organisation, or classify the tone of the language used to ensure it
is appropriate.
