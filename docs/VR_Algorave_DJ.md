Why can't a DJ be more like an orchestra conductor, remixing
instrumental sections and adding new expressive content, instead of
simply selecting from a library of prerecorded tracks? In the future
this will be possible, using gesture controllers in virtual reality.
Your task is to create a VR space in which the DJs of the future will
edit and configure algorave-style music synthesis programs. You can use
APIs for the Sonic Pi music language from Cambridge's Sam Aaron as a
back end to produce professional-standard musical results. We can
provide an Oculus Rift and Myo gesture control armband for an immersive
experience (and some professional audio gear for the demonstration day).
