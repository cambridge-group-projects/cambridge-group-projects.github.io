Children and other beginners can understand the computational concepts
involved in physical computing (controlling electronics components)
before they are ready for the technical APIs provided to control
hardware devices. Your task is to design and prototype a visual language
or interface for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller that
can be used by beginners. The language should use concepts that are
close to the kinds of projects that beginners would want to create.
Users might drag and drop components such as buttons and LEDs and then
click on them to configure how they should behave.
