Low-income countries often have widespread network coverage to rural
areas, but the devices and data contracts available to subsistence
farmers make voice and SMS more practical then web services. You need to
design a subscriber service that provides automated weather, health and
market updates which users can personalise to their needs from a basic
feature phone. You may need to use SMS gateways, off the shelf
Interactive Voice Response techniques, and public APIs for information
sources. Keep in mind the need for security, accessibility to low
literacy users, and simultaneous support for a large number of local
languages.
