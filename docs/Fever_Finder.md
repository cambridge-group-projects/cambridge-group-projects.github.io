Google Flu Trends was a famous (but unsuccessful) attempt to predict flu
outbreaks on the basis of anxious people searching for symptoms. A more
pressing need is to work out whether people in remote villages might be
harbouring an outbreak of Lassa, Zika or Ebola. Your goal is to design a
smartphone-based field station that geolocates fever symptoms for
members of a family or village, using technology from Cambridge startup
SimPrints to identify individual cases. With advice from an infectious
disease specialist, you can use machine learning to model potential
outbreaks as they occur.
