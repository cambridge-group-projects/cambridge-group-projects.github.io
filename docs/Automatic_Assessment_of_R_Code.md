Cambridge Sparkâ€™s EDUKATE.AI platform gives students automated feedback
on Python and Java code based on functionality and code quality.
Students write code and submit it for processing by a set of tests
running in Docker containers, resulting in errors, failures and other
data subsequently used to provide feedback to the student about what
failed and why, plus metrics of code quality. We wish you to add support
for R to the platform, potentially to the extent of providing an SDK to
help for exercise developers to write exercises and associated tests
more quickly.
