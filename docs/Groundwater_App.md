British Antarctic Survey has developed a compact ground-penetrating
radar for measuring melt rates at the base of ice-sheets. In principle,
the same device can be used to locate groundwater in arid regions,
guiding borehole drilling and supporting groundwater management. Your
task is to create an app that runs on a smartphone, able to take data
from the radar equipment and estimate groundwater depth. You will have
access to a variety of signal processing research algorithms (in Matlab)
that process the radar data at present, and your code may involve
translations, adaptations or refinements of these. Your software should
provide simple visualisations to help nontechnical users control the
system and interpret its output, and also make use of the phone storage
for “sneakernet” transfer of data to servers for more intensive
cloud-based analysis by technical specialists.
