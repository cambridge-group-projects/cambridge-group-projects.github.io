One of the group project coordinators recently attended an outpatient
audiology clinic at Addenbrooke’s hospital, cycling from the William
Gates Building. His navigation tools totally let him down – after
entering the Addenbrooke’s site, half his route was by bike, while the
other half was a maze of indoor corridors. Your task is to build an
outdoor/indoor navigation app that helps Cambridge locals get to their
hospital appointments, using APIs to the University Map, and adapting
the open source OpenRoomMap for specialised hospital data.
