Many people are concerned that their phone provider (whether Apple,
Samsung or Google) effectively controls their whole life, tying them in
to an ecosystem of other products and services. This is very different
from an earlier age, when the Internet of Things was expected to provide
“information appliances” that offered self-contained functionality
rather than surveillance capitalism. Your task is to prototype a
privacy-preserving digital twin architecture that allows customers to
interface in an intelligent way with specific devices (examples in
Cambridge might be a smart bicycle with embedded GoPro, or the door lock
of your college room), while strictly constraining the way this
functionality gets connected to other parts of their digital life.
