The human visual system is highly evolved to recognise faces even from a
few lines. AI systems are improving, but we need more efficient tools to
communicate which lines are meaningful to humans. The goal of this
project is to create a tool for drawing the most essential lines onto
photographed faces, as a starting point for psychological research into
this fascinating human skill.
