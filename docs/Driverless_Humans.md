Client: Daniel Clarke, Cambridgeshire County Council

Cambridge is at the leading edge of many tech developments, including
imminent trials of driverless buses, as well as the data infrastructure
driving large status displays like the one by the WGB front door. Your
task is to use the data infrastructure to solve one of the biggest
problems with driverless buses - who will help wheelchair users,
visually and cognitively impaired, or those with other mobility problems
to get on and off the bus? Your design solution should integrate
location services with realtime data from every bus in Cambridge, to
help connect those who need assistance to those able to provide it.
