People with different sensory capabilities or diverse neural styles
sometimes find it easier to communicate via a musical instrument or a
piano keyboard than with the screen and keyboard of a laptop. The goal
of this project is to make an alternative kind of music editor that
works with text and sound as the elements, rather than working with
music notation on the computer screen. The open source synthesiser
SuperCollider generates professional quality sound, but you would
replace the sclang programming language with a natural language
interactive text system that could be driven from an assistive keyboard
or screen reader.
