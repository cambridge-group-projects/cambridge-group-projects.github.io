In videogame worlds, checkpoints are a welcome way to avoid hours of
button-mashing. But the usual convention in a game is that time simply
rewinds to the checkpoint, like the eternal repeats in the movie
Groundhog Day. What if a checkpoint worked like a functional programming
continuation, where state could be directly manipulated before
continuing? With the Verse functional programming language integrated
into Epic Games infrastructure, this project will be an opportunity to
invent new kinds of gameplay. You'll need to think about what parts of
the state can be rendered in the game, and how the player can make the
game modify itself at this meta-level.
