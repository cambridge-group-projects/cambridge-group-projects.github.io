Client: Adham Ashton-Butt, BTO <adham.ashton-butt@bto.org>

Land managers are often responsible for restoration projects, in which
they make changes expected to benefit wildlife over time. One very
useful source of evidence is acoustic data recordings. This project is
intended to create an interactive application that can be used by land
managers to visualise, make decisions, monitor, and evaluate their
interventions, based on bioacoustic survey data processed through the
BTO acoustic pipeline and enhanced with machine learning methods.
