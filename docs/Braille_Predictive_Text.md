David MacKay’s Dasher was a radical predictive text system where a
machine learning language model helped users with disabilities by
guiding them to zoom in to more likely possible texts. That’s no use for
people with a vision impairment, who can’t see the guidance or easily
operate animated graphical interfaces. This is an opportunity to work
with a team who have recently augmented the classic mechanical Braille
typewriter with internet connectivity. Your prediction model will help
users to learn and master Braille, by offering appropriate spoken
suggestions on what word they might be typing and (if needed) remind
them which keys they might need to press next. All this will have to be
designed in a way that is helpful, motivational and accessible, not an
additional obstacle to learning Braille!
