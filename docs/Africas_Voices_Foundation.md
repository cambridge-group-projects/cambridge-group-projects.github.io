2020 project: [Probably Helpful
Planning](Probably_Helpful_Planning "wikilink")

Draft:

Basic idea is to create a front end to a probabilistic programming
language (e.g. Stan) that allows evaluation of likelihood models for
famine relief scenarios. Results should be usable by UN aid workers.
Technical challenge will be creating a geographic distribution model
that reflects differing degrees of certainty that a delivery will be
made, and compare investment scenarios. There will be an opportunity for
members of the team to interact with a student team from Potsdam, also
working with AVF.
