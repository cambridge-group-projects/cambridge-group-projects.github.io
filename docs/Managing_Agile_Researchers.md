Software companies use agile project management to ensure that a backlog
of feature requests is implemented in a timely way. Universities are not
so agile, but often employ people with a wide range of technical skills,
including computer officers and research engineers. Your task is to use
natural language processing methods to automatically collect and
classify skill areas from GitHub and StackOverflow accounts associated
with Cambridge staff, and match these against feature requirements in a
backlog of requests such as “collect lecture feedback”, “improve
performance of video download on Android” and so on. It’s likely that
web pages or research publications associated with the individuals will
provide further natural language clues to relevant application areas.
