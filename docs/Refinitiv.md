I would indeed love to get Refinitiv and the [London Stock Exchange
Group](London_Stock_Exchange_Group "wikilink") (we are merging at the
moment) to engage with the group projects. We have a 60PB treasure trove
of data and tools that students could theoretically play with, including
the high interest area of ESG.

Response:

Do you think that it might be an interesting challenge for students to
engage with some of the infrastructure design questions too? For
example, I expect your day to day work with that data relies on high-end
compute and networks. We could ask students to create scalable toolchain
for any range of specification - perhaps down to a Raspberry Pi, or
low-end Android phone on a 2G data connection (a typical scenario in
Ethiopia)?
