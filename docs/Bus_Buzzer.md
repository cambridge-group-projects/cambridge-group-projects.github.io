We have near-realtime data on location of every bus in Cambridge. This
could be used to give guidance for cyclists to take alternative routes
when there are large numbers of buses ahead. Wrist vibration makes sense
as an output mode for cyclists, because they have no dashboard, and
would not routinely be looking down at handlebars. It's also hard to
hear alerts from a mobile phone while cycling, and dangerous to look at
a phone without stopping.
