It's hard to provide famine relief unless you can predict where it might
take place. Your task is to build a front end to a probabilistic
programming language (Stan) that allows models to be built to explore
the likelihood of need based on factors such as weather and crop cycles,
and to compare different intervention scenarios to produce plans. The
results should be usable by UN aid workers. There will be an opportunity
for members of the team to interact with a student team from Potsdam,
also working with Africas Voices.
