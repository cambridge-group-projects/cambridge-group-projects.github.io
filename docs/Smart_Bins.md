To help people become more sustainable, we would like to give them
insights in their waste production. Your task is to develop a smart
waste management system that keeps track of how you are disposing your
waste. The idea being to make it more transparent so you can highlight
areas to improve. The container would automatically weigh waste, and
provide the user with insights through an app, so they see how their
waste metrics compares to global and regional averages. A further
feature could be to use image recognition to classify waste types, or to
allow users to compete with friends on sustainability.
