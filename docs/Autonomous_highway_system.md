Highway congestion is a never ending problem. One way to increase the
throughput of the highway is to group vehicles into platoons to shorten
the distance between two consecutive cars. Further advantages of vehicle
platooning are decreased fuel consumption and emissions and increased
safety and comfort. Design an automated platooning system in which
multiple vehicles autonomously follow the leader. Safety is of paramount
importance, each vehicle should do its best to avoid collisions. The
goal is to develop a platoon simulation which can be backtested with 3
Lego Mindstorms vehicles.
