A core activity of the Conservation Evidence team in the Department of
Zoology is compiling and summarising research literature, to provide
evidence for which management approaches are most effective for
biodiversity conservation. However, this evidence is dispersed in many
different scientific journals, in English and non-English language
journals, and in non-academic (“grey”) literature. The Group needs tools
that can use natural language processing methods to constantly monitor
publications across many different venues, initially classifying studies
as relevant or not to different biological taxa, and then extracting key
attributes such as geography, habitat, threats or interventions and
organising these for thematic browsing or targeted queries. The group
would also like to explore the possibility of using natural language
processing to summarise study findings.
