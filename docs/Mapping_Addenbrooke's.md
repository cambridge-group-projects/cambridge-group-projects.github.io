I’m chasing up the remaining design briefs for projects next year. I’d
be happy to contact your IfM colleague directly, if that would help.

Yes I am interested in following up. I discovered a colleague in IfM has
done a project streamlining processes within the hospital. We will think
of a project discription.

Original enquiry:

A question and a project proposal:

I am interested in visualising the Addenbrooke's Hospital departments
and affiliated CBC institutes by developing an Android or iPhone APP.
This would be for researchers, clinicians and patients.

Background: I am developing a technology platforms network across
Cambridge with support from CUHP and Pro-VC Chris Abell and the clinical
school.

I am using Google Maps and geo-coding to localize labs and facilities in
the wider Cambridge area. But: the Hospital Site is really difficult to
geo-code as all departments use one postcode.

Feedback:

Do you know whether the University Map is staying reasonably up to date?
In principle, they do show location of departments and institutes around
Addenbrookes:
