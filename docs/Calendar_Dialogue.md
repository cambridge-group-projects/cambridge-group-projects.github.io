The Alexa Skills Kit allows developers to create new functionality for
the Amazon Echo. You will use this to implement a natural language
meeting-time negotiator. Multiple simultaneous users each speak to their
own Echo, which constructs an independent calendar representation of
constraints, conflicts and priorities while ignoring time-wasting
details so that the users can have a focused productive negotiation
rather than rambling natural language discussion.
