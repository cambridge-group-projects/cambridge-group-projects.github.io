It is possible to make accurate 3D scans of indoor scenes using depth
cameras such as Google Tango or expensive LIDAR scanners. Although the
overall geometry is accurate, individual objects cannot be
distinguished. Your task is to use a simple SLAM algorithm to recover
overall room dimensions, but populate a navigable virtual world in
OpenGL using standard 3D library models of furniture and other objects
that have been recognised as belonging to relevant categories using
pre-trained deep neural net models such as NeuralTalk Model Zoo.
