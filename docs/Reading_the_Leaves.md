Plant leaves are anatomically complex but can be structured in ways to
make a digital model of the plant. In this project your goal will be to
use time-lapse photography to render a 3D model of plants growing in a
vertical farm in real-time; mapping a grid-search of chlorophyll
fluorescence measurements and displaying phenotype properties such as
leaf area and weight, calibrated against ground truth measurements.
