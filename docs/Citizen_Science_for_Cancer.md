Many people enjoy helping with research by completing simple but
satisfying classification and recognition tasks online. Examples include
the classic Galaxy Zoo, and recent initiatives such as the BBC Your
Paintings Tagger. This project aims to design a similar approach to
recognise cancer mutations from gene sequencing data, comparing
sequences that are different between cancer mutations and healthy cells
from the same person. It is relatively easy for people to spot the
difference between actual cancers and false positive mutations - your
job is to design an engaging online game teaching people to do this task
well, and an infrastructure for collecting and analysing the results
from large numbers of volunteers, with appropriate account management,
motivation scoring and other features that result in effective citizen
science projects.
