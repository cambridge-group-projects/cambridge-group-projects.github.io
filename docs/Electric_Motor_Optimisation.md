Electric motors are all around us and together consume about half of the
world's electricity. Even small improvements can therefore have large
global impacts. Your task is to streamline the early experimental
process of motor design, allowing a domain expert to prototype a good
design more quickly and/or produce a better design before they reach
their deadline. This will involve building an intuitive interface for
designing motors, learning about the underlying computational models,
and analysing and displaying the results in a way that highlights
important features.
