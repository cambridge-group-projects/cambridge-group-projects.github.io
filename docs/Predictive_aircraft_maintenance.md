Local company Satavia helps airlines and aircraft engine manufacturers
to schedule maintenance based on the amount of exposure the components
have had to air pollution, dust, ice, volcanic ash and other
environmental factors. They have large data sets which could be used to
train predictive models that might be added to the Microsoft Cortana
Intelligence Solution Template Playbook (assistance from Microsoft
Research will be available) for predictive maintenance in aerospace. You
will need to deliver a data ingestion architecture for a range of global
data, and also demonstrate an aircraft maintenance scheduling
application based on machine learning that applies the results.
