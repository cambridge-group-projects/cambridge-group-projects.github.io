The RSPB have many hours of acoustic data recorded from bird colonies,
which is becoming a valuable resource for conservation work such as
monitoring changes in colony size, or the relative composition of
different species. Your task will be to create a convenient set of tools
for machine learning experiments using these data. You will be free to
make your own suggestions, but tools for segmentation and classification
will be important starting points. The tools should be packaged in a way
that is convenient and easy for RSPB staff without computer science
training.
