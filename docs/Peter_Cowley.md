[Countryside web server](Countryside_web_server "wikilink")

A ruggedized version of the Raspberry Pi can be used for outdoor
applications, like monitoring wildlife activity via analogue and digital
inputs. The kinds of hobbyist and researcher who do this need to specify
data capture via a rubberised keyboard and LCD display, but also make
that data available more widely via popular websites. Your task is to
design a system that allows users to configure battery-powered data
capture and website structure in the field via the embedded display, but
then turn the same device into a fully-functional web server with data
visualisations when it is brought inside and plugged back into a network
port. If required, you will also be provided with a licence for the ENEA
Polyhedra realtime embedded database.
