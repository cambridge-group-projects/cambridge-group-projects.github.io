Cambridge composer Ewan Campbell creates beautiful graphic scores where
the musical notes are curved and rendered over map landscapes or nature
photographs. At present these have to be translated into conventional
music notation to make them playable, but your task is to create a
continuously animated view controller that navigates around the score as
it is played. Your software will be used in live performance at the
Cambridge Festival, where a new nature-based work by Ewan is being
commissioned in collaboration with Birdlife International.
