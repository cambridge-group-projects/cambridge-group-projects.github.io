The past year has seen a significant rise in awareness of misogyny,
racism and other discrimination in society and, in particular, in
workplaces. In addition, there is growing awareness of how ‘algorithms’
can reinforce bias rather than remove it. Your task is to produce a
system that can help businesses recruit more fairly, by removing biased
language from their job adverts that would put off many candidates. Your
system should allow users to upload the text for a job ad, to identify
problems using natural-language processing and statistics, and to
recommend changes to the user so that they can make iterative
improvements. Ideally, your system would give each text an overall score
as well as word-level feedback.
