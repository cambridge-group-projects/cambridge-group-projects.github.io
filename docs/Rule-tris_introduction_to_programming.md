All kids love Tetris, so why not help them learn programming by making a
Tetris-playing robot? You need to start with a simple Tetris port on the
Raspberry Pi (code your own, or use an open source version), then add
facilities allowing kids to "play" it automatically with the assistance
of an interpreted rule language. This language can be applied by users
to define piece rotations and movements based on queries of the current
game state and simple algebraic expressions. The rule condition queries
and actions must be sufficiently constrained that it would take
significant coding effort to make an optimal player, but should also be
simple enough to provide incremental feedback for students, so that each
new rule (if correctly specified) produces satisfying improvements.
