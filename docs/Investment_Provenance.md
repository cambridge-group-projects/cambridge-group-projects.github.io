There are many online forums that offer investment advice, but not much
of it is original. Your task is to create a tool for use by traders,
that annotates investment tips with a plausible history of where they
might have come from. Any correlation with historically objective
information, such as share price movements, may be a helpful source of
causal evidence. This project is likely to require some research into
text processing algorithms and statistics, as well as an intuitive front
end that helps users understand the "genetics" of specific investment
trends and memes.
