Researchers critical of the persistent 'AI hype' – driven by flashy
headlines and corporate communications – have pointed to the harmful
effects that misrepresentations of AI in the media might have on public
perceptions of the technology. Your task is to create an automated
monitor of AI hype content, based on a predetermined classification
system of particularly problematic metaphors and comparisons common in
news articles about AI that circulate on social media. Ideally, the AI
Hype Monitor could be used as an add-on filter for chosen social media
applications, flagging up problematic content and pointing users to
sources that represent current AI capabilities more accurately and
responsibly.
