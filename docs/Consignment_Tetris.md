Short-run manufacturers can now supply arbitrary bulk parts for 3D
printing and online delivery, but manually packing a wide range of 3D
shapes is difficult for robots. Your task is to design a system that
will take a random selection of 3D models (e.g. as might be printed from
clara.io/library), and use twin robot arms to fit them together into
delivery boxes. You will simulate the system's kinematic and dynamic
performance using Simulink 3D animation & Simscape Multibody in
conjunction with a high-fidelity robotic arm model from MATLABâ€™s
Robotics System Toolbox.
