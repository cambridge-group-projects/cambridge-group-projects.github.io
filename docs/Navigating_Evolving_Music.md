Client: Ewan Campbell, Music Faculty <eahc2@cam.ac.uk>

Cambridge composer Ewan Campbell creates cartographic scores where the
musical notes are curved and rendered over maps or other pictorial
representations of nature. His next project is to use the evolution of
musical ideas to reflect the processes of zoological development and
mass extinctions. The arboreal subdivision of evolutionary trees very
quickly renders traditional notational formats impractical for
displaying the array of musical path options available for the
performers. Your task will be to create a real-time continuously
animating programme that is able to be run simultaneously by several
different aligned performers, offering them live musical options, whilst
allowing them to control their pathway. Your software will have an
initial array of musical fragments to work with, but will also need to
be able to accommodate new pieces written to use the software, and
subsequently presented in live performances at the Cambridge Festival,
where a new nature-based work by Ewan is being commissioned.
