Bring-up and optimisation of SYCL on a high-performance RISC-V
platform - sponsored by Rivos and Intel. We could target it towards a
specific application if desired, so we could give it some direct
business relationship, and that would also give it some specific goals.
I think it's a pretty interesting space - and it does have a real
business purpose for us.

We could certainly try and have a LLM/ChatGPT/other application running
on-top of SYCL for example, and that could be prettified. Or anything
relevant.
