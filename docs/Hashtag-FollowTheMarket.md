Sentiment analysis of social media is now fairly routine, but it's still
relatively new in the world of finance. Coupling popular sentiment with
market data could provide a very useful tool for financial decision
makers. Your task is to derive sentiment data from Twitter and present
its relationship to market data in a tool for traders to test their
knowledge of the market. The user selects a date range and a stock, and
is then asked to sketch a graph of how they believe popular sentiment
and stock price trends behaved over that time. The system gives visual
feedback, and awards a competition score based on comparison to the
actual data. This system might be used simply for practice and training,
or as a game for would-be traders. But in the long term, statistical
data showing the ways in which the judgments of real traders predict (or
lag) Twitter trends might provide an extremely valuable product!
