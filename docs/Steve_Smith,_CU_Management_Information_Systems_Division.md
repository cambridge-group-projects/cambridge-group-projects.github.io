In the past, we've had some projects that used data from the Talks.cam
API. Perhaps we could do something that identified current research
grants from CUFS, correlated them with research subjects at seminars
advertised in talks.cam, then advertised them to students who were
registered for relevant exams via CamSIS?

Track down the experts

Undergraduate students in Cambridge are not always given the opportunity
to meet research staff whose work is related to their lectures. Some of
those staff give lectures and supervise, but others are just hidden away
in labs. However, there are university systems that could be combined to
locate expert researchers - for example, use your CamSIS exam entry
codes to find course titles and syllabus, use the university financial
system to discover which research labs receive funding in related areas,
correlate the teaching and research keywords using the interface to
talks.cam, and find out where those researchers meet via the API to the
University online map. There are some tricky technical problems in all
this, but we do have permission for you to use the relevant service
interfaces. Cambridge is already a world leader in producing students
who are up-to-date in recent research, but a system like this could
provide the most stimulating degrees in the world!
