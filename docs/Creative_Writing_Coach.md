Will human authors be replaced by AI? Language models can convincingly
generate human-sounding text and automate many writing tasks, even
contributing to novels! Instead, could they be harnessed to make us all
more creative? The goal of this project is to create an app in the style
of Duolingo. This app will use bite-sized, gamified lessons to help
students write more creatively, with poetic imagery, dramatic tension,
and vivid characterisation. Experiments show that a standard LLM (with
carefully designed prompts) can provide useful feedback. Your app needs
to engage and motivate students to become more fluent and confident
creative writers.
