When people are reported missing to the Metropolitan Police, and
specialist search advice is required to try and find them and return
them to safety, Police Search Advisors are assigned to the case. One of
the search tools used to assist locating the missing is documented
statistics from previous cases. However, the current data used is 8
years old and none of the data studied was from London. Police Search
advisors cannot be familiar with all the thousands of cases in their
database and London's individual demographics are likely to display
behaviours and patterns unique to London. Your task is to use (an
anonymised version of) their database to help visualise and guide search
efforts, based on the characteristics of similar cases in the past. Note
that this team will need to interact with data that is sensitive and may
be distressing.
