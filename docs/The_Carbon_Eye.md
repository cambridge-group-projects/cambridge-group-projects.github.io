We all want to be warm in winter, but how can we do it without fossil
fuels? British houses are woefully poor in their level of preparation
for a zero carbon economy. This project will develop an app to be used
with a thermal imaging camera phone accessory like the FLIR ONE Gen 3,
to estimate carbon costs of the heat escaping from a building, and
directly calculate financial costs and benefits of insulation, draft
reduction, secondary glazing, heat pump installation etc.
