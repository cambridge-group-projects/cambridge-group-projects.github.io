PDF documents lead a double life, on screen and as hard copies. But when
people modify hard copies (such as the proofreading marks that copy
editors use, or annotations by students on their lecture notes), the
digital versions stay the same. If you have a photo of an annotated
document, it should be possible to match this against the PDF image,
extract the annotations as an image diff, and apply them to the PDF. The
simplest approach is just to overlay the annotation ink as a bitmap, but
ideally, proofreading marks should be interpreted as edit operations on
the original document, potentially including OCR of any clearly
handwritten text. Your client can provide some specialist assistance in
PDF processing.
