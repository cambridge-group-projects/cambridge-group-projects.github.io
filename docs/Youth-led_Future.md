Client: Oliver Williams, [Curriculum for
Life](Curriculum_for_Life "wikilink") <oli@curriculumforlife.com>

Most young people (in wealthy countries) now have their education
controlled via virtual learning environments. But preparation for the
future will involve challenging the curriculum, not just accepting the
status quo. Your task is to create an alternative mobile browser that
school students can use to construct a customised view which
collaboratively annotates, critiques, adjusts and (re)evaluates the
front end facilities of their school’s VLE. Just like the school strikes
for climate, it shouldn’t be necessary to wait for permission, when
creating youth-led alternatives to established skills and
qualifications. This can’t be just another social media platform -
Facebook is clearly the wrong model!
