The UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre wants to improve public
engagement with wildlife conservation. One very successful approach is
to help those interested in wild animals to learn more about their daily
activities, and to imagine the environments that the animals have to
survive in. The goal of this project is to create a game that runs on a
mobile phone platform, allowing players to compare their own movements
to those of wild animals that are fitted with satellite tracking
devices. You are free to design a game scenario in any genre that makes
use of play location data and animal tracking information.
