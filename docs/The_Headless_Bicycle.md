An unfortunate accident during the 2018 group design projects resulted
in us blowing up the display head of an exercise bicycle loaned to us by
a project client/ Your task is to revive it with a virtual reality
rolling road display, using the same sensor data supplied to the old
display. One possibility would be to cycle on real roads, using Google
Streetview imagery to virtually leave the Gates Building. Interactive
games could also be considered.

Has been proposed as a possible project for [Smart
Cambridge](Smart_Cambridge "wikilink"). in combination with public
transport data feeds
