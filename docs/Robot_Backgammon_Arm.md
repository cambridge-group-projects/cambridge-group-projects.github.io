Challenges in game theory the likes of Deep Blue and AlphaGo have
inspired generations of AI enthusiasts and researchers. Your objective
is to design, build and teach a robotic manipulator arm to play the
classic game of Backgammon. Your team will be able to test their
knowledge of robotics, computer vision, game theory and neural networks.
The team will have access to a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and a Raspberry
Pi board & webcams to design and build the system. MathWorks offers
several hardware support packages for MATLAB and Simulink to simplify
deployment of these kits and boards.
