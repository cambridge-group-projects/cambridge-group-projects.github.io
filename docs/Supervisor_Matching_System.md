Finding supervisors for courses is difficult. The CL runs a wiki where
supervisors can indicate their interest for specific courses, but the
information quickly becomes stale. Your task is to produce a web-based
system allowing potential supervisors to mark all courses they are able
to supervise along with preferences for numbers (and perhaps college),
and which then indicates their remaining capacity for the relevant
period. It should provide easy data entry and a convenient view for
DoSes to see who is supervising what and when. When the core is
complete, there are a variety of extensions envisaged.
