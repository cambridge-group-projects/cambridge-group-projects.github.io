Language models like ChatGPT and Claude.ai are becoming increasingly
popular. These models affect every line of work, including student
assignments. For some assignments, professors require students to hand
in authentic work for their own personal development, not for the sake
of handing in an assignment. In this project, you will design a system
that is able to reliably detect text generated by LLMs in student
assignments. User experience is a top priority; the system should be
fast and simple to use. How will you test, measure or prove this? It
should integrate seamlessly with the learning environment of Cambridge.
The detection framework could use machine learning, but could an MVP use
more simple approaches? What heuristics might determine if text is
written by a human? Reports should offer statistics line-by-line,
highlighting which parts are human-written or machine-written.
