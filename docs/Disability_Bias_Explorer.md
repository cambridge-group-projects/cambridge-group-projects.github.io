Recent work led by a team at ethical AI initiative Hugging Face
(arXiv:2303.11408) demonstrated a tool that could be used to
interactively investigate some of the race and gender biases that have
become encoded in major text to image generation systems. Your task is
to create a similar tool that could be used to demonstrate image
generation biases relevant to visual disabilities. You may also need to
consider how this tool can be made accessible to users who have visual
disabilities themselves.
