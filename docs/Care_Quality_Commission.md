I spoke to Paul yesterday. We are both interested in principle however
we are currently in the process of procuring a tool that will, in brief,
automate aspects of CQC's qualitative analysis. I imagine Paul /
Katherine previously mentioned this to you hence your suggested project
below.

It might be interesting to have the students explore a 'spin-off'
project from this (it's unlikely that whatever tool we procure will be a
panacea!), but given we don't have the tool yet it might not be the
right time for us to explore these options. Perhaps, if it's an annual
student project, it's something we could consider next year? By that
point, we would hope to have the tool up and running and we might have
identified further business needs.

So, it is probably a 'no' for now but I'd be keen to discuss the longer
term opportunities when we meet on 2nd Nov.

Finally, thank you for considering us as a potential client. I have had
positive experiences of student projects in previous roles, so it's
something I'm always keen to consider.
