Many published descriptions of conservation projects contain information
about the actions that were taken, what they cost, and how effective the
results were. However, itâ€™s impossible for one person to find and digest
the corresponding pieces of evidence when the relevant publications can
be so varied in format and length. Your task is to use natural language
processing methods to assemble the most important quantitative and
qualitative data, and generate short and approachable texts
communicating the essentials of each publication.
