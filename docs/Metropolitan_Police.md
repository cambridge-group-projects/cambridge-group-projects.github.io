Mapping the Missing

When people go missing in London because of mental health or family
problems, the Metropolitan Police use examples of previous cases to help
find and return them to safety. But even expert tracers canâ€™t be
familiar with all the thousands of cases in their database. Your task is
to use (an anonymised version of) their database to help visualise and
guide search efforts, based on the characteristics of similar cases in
the past. Note that this team will need to interact with data that is
sensitive and may be distressing.
