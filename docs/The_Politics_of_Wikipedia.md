Much of the content of Wikipedia is encyclopaedia-like, but Wikipedia
editors also respond to current events. The goal of this project is to
highlight which parts of Wikipedia are more political (or at least
contemporary), by correlating Wikipedia edits with recent traffic on
Twitter. You should create a custom application for viewing Wikipedia,
in which the content the user sees is customised and updated to follow
Twitter traffic. Users should be able to navigate according to recency,
popularity, or controversy. They should also have some way to know
(through correlation analysis) when different topics or pages appear to
be alternative views of the same underlying events.
