Autonomous vehicles are likely a wave of the future. A lot of effort is
going into automating the control of individual vehicles to provide a
self-driving version of our current experience. An alternative is
centralized control of fleets of vehicles to optimize large-scale
traffic flow. This is a simpler problem which might be very appealing
for transport of goods by truck. The brief is to build a simulation
environment to demonstrate centralized control of a fleet of trucks. The
simulation should consist of three elements: a) a traffic optimization
algorithm which achieves maximal transport of goods, given boundary
conditions for trucks joining and leaving the flow of traffic, b) a
visualization of the traffic flow, c) control of the traffic variables,
including highway pattern (on-ramps, off-ramps), rates of trucks
entering and leaving the traffic pattern, basic dynamic properties of
trucks (e.g. maximum rate of acceleration/deceleration).
