Children today struggle with mental health challenges, and it seems from
research that the social dynamics of platforms like Instagram do not
help. There are alternative approaches to building community, for
example the way that TikTok encourages users to build on each otherâ€™s
contributions with memes, challenges and reaction videos rather than
just accumulate likes (see
<https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2021/2/15/american-idle>). Your task is
to create a mobile app that develops community through creative
quotation and remixing, with feedback mechanisms that emphasise quality
rather than quantity. TikTok already exists, so this app will be focused
on phone-based drawing, painting and image remixing, rather than video.
