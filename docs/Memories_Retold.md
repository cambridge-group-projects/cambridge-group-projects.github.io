Design and develop an application to help people with memory loss create
an oral history through interactive prompted storytelling. The
application should use AI to identify suggested talking points and ask
contextual questions to trigger the unlocking of long-term memories. The
application should accept images as input prompts, and use
speech-to-text conversion to capture the user's responses. Ethical
aspects should be considered, including who might use the application,
in which circumstances, and when.
